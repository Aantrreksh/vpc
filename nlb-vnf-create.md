# Creating a route mode Network Load Balancer for VPC
{: #nlb-vnf}

Virtual Network Function (VNF) devices are virtualized network services (such as routers and firewalls) running on virtual machines. With {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you can provision VNF devices to gain better and more affordable scalability than you would by purchasing physical network devices.

Traffic destined for servers in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} must be delivered to healthy VNF devices; otherwise, traffic disruption occurs. You can use network load balancers with route mode to perform health checks and to ensure that workloads only travel through healthy VNF devices. Because of this, network load balancers with route mode support only VNF devices as back-end targets.

## Prerequisites for NLB with route mode
{: #nlb-vnf-prereqs}

To support route mode, you must first create a service-to-service authentication policy for your NLB. To do, follow these steps:

1. From your browser, log in to [IBM Access Management](/iam/authorizations/grant).
1. Click **Authorizations**, then click **Create**.
1. For the source service, select **VPC Infrastructure Services**.
   For scope access, select **Resources based on selected attributes** > **Resource Type** > **Load Balancer for VPC**.
1. For the target service, select **VPC Infrastructure Services**.
   For scope access, select **Resources based on selected attributes** > **Resource Type** > **Virtual Private Cloud**.

## Creating a route mode network load balancer using the UI
{: #nlb-vnf-ui}
{: ui}

To create and configure {{site.data.keyword.nlb_full}} with route mode using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, follow these steps:

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com){: external} and log in to your account.
1. Select the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) from the upper left, then click **VPC Infrastructure > Load balancers**.
1. Click **New load balancer +** in the upper right of the page.
1. In the order form, complete the following information:
   * Type a unique name for your load balancer and select a VPC.
   * Select a resource group. Use the default group, or select from the list (if defined for your account). You cannot change the resource group after the load balancer is created.
   * Select the **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** tile and the subnet where you want to deploy the load balancer.
   * Select the **Private** type.
   * Optionally, add tags.
1. Review the checklist instructions in the route mode window, then click the button to enable it.

   You cannot modify the configuration of a route mode NLB after it finishes provisioning. 
   {: important}
1. Click **New Pool** and specify the following information to create a back-end pool. 
   * Type a name for the pool, such as `my-pool`.
   * Enter a protocol for your instances in this pool. The protocol of the pool must match the protocol of its associated listener. For example, if the listener is TCP, the protocol of the pool must be TCP.
   * Select the method, which is the load-balancing algorithm. The follow options are shown.
      * **Round robin** - Forward requests to each instance in turn. All instances receive approximately an equal number of client connections.
      * **Weighted round robin** - Forward requests to each instance in proportion to its assigned weight. For example, you have instances A, B, and C, and their weights are set to 60, 60, and 30. Instances A and B receive an equal number of connections, and instance C receives half as many connections.
      * **Least connections** - Forward requests to the instance with the least number of connections at the current time.
   * Choose session stickiness and select **None** or **Source IP**.
   * Under the health checks, the following options are shown.
      * **Health check path** - Health path is applicable only if **HTTP** is selected as the health check protocol. The health path specifies the URL used by the load balancer to send the HTTP health check requests to the instances in the pool. By default, health checks are sent to the root path (/).
      * **Health protocol** - The protocol used by the load balancer to send health check messages to the instances in the pool.
      * **Health port** - The port on which to send health check requests. By default, health checks are sent on the same port on which traffic is sent to the instance.
      * **Interval** - The interval, in seconds, between two consecutive health check attempts. By default, health checks are sent every 5 seconds.
      * **Timeout** - Maximum amount of time the system waits for a response from a health check request. By default, the load balancer waits 2 seconds for a response.
      * **Max retries** - Maximum number of health check attempts that the load balancer makes before an instance is declared unhealthy. By default, an instance is no longer considered healthy after two failed health checks.

      Although the load balancer stops sending connections to unhealthy instances, the load balancer continues monitoring the health of these instances and resumes their use if they're found healthy again (that is, if they successfully pass two consecutive health check attempts).

      If instances in the pool are unhealthy and you believe that your application is running fine, double check the health protocol and health path values. Also, check any security groups that are attached to the instances to ensure that the rules allow traffic between the load balancer and the instances.
      {: tip}

1. Click **New listener** and specify the back-end pool to which this listener forwards traffic. 
      
   The protocol for receiving incoming requests, as well as the listening port on which requests are received, are already selected for you. 
   {: note}
   
1. An order summary shows pricing estimates. Review the Cloud Services terms. Then, click **Create** to complete your order.

## Creating a route mode network load balancer using the CLI
{: #nlb-vnf-cli}
{: cli}

To create a network load balancer using the CLI, follow these steps:

1. Set up your [CLI environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-infrastructure-cli-plugin-vpc-reference).

1. Log in to your account using the CLI. After you enter the password, the system prompts which account and region that you want to use:

   ```
   ibmcloud login --sso
   ```
   {: pre}

1. Create a load balancer:

   ```
   ibmcloud is load-balancer-create nlb-test public --subnet 0896-b1f24514-89dc-4afd-b0e2-5489a43cf45c --family network --route-mode true
   ```

## Creating a route mode network load balancer using the API
{: #nlb-vnf-api}
{: api}

To create a network load balancer by using the API, follow these steps:

1. Set up your [API environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#api-prerequisites-setup).
1. Create your API request payload using the following template. Modify the name and subnet with your own values.

   ```
   {
      "name": "nlb-vnf",
      "is_public": false,
      "profile": {
         "name": "network-fixed"
         },
      "route_mode": true,
      "subnets": [
         {
      "id": "0767-064498f3-4df5-4fa5-b2ed-de5a3bfea024"
         }
       ]
   }
   ```
   {: pre}
   
   Save this payload to a JSON file. In the following examples, the file is named `create.json`.

1. Make the request to create your NLB with the following command.
Â 
   The following properties must be set in the payload: 

      - `route_mode` is `true`
      - `is_public` is `false`
      - Profile name is `network_fixed`

1. Wait until the NLB is in an active state, then add a listener.Â 

   The port range for the listener must be defined as follows: 
   - `port_min` is `1` 
   - `port_max` is `65535`

   Create an API request payload using the following template:

   ```
   {
   Â  "default_pool": {
       "id": "r014-0b8f4cde-4684-484b-bd3c-64f55a917328"
     },
     "port_min": 1,
     "port_max": 65535,
     "protocol": "tcp"
   }
   ```
   {: pre}

   Run the following command:

   ```sh
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" -X POST -d @create_vnf.json "https://us-east.iaas.cloud.ibm.com/v1/load_balancers/r014-020f4f34-bb49-4699-98a7-a53384cd649d/listeners?version=2021-07-30&generation=2" | jq
   ```

1. Add the pool member.

   First, create an API request payload using the following template:

   ```
   {
   Â  "port": 90,
     "target": {
       "id": "0767_5545cfb3-febc-4f09-b9ea-0aeb66074edf"
     }
   }
   ```
   {: pre}

   Then run the following command:

   ```sh
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $IAM_TOKEN" -X POST -d @add_member.json "https://us-east.iaas.cloud.ibm.com/v1/load_balancers/r014-020f4f34-bb49-4699-98a7-a53384cd649d/pools/r014-0b8f4cde-4684-484b-bd3c-64f55a917328/members?version=2021-07-30&generation=2" | jq

## Next steps
{: #nob-vnf-nextsteps}

After the NLB with route mode enabled is in active state, follow these steps to finalize the creation of your NLB:

1. Gather the following information:
   * Your subnet CIDR.
   * In the load balancer response, you will find a list of private IPs. Make note of the first one. 
   
      You can generate this response by performing step 4 of either the [CLI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-vnf&interface=cli#nlb-vnf-cli) or [API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-vnf&interface=api) procedures.

   * Your back-end workload subnet CIDR.

1. Configure your custom routes as follows:
   * For all traffic destined for the backend customer workload subnet, set the next hop to the NLB private IP.
   * For all traffic destined for the client subnet, set the next hop to the NLB private IP.
