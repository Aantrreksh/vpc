# Getting access to VPC
{: #getting-access}

To request access to the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} early access program, send an email from your company email account to vpc@us.ibm.com and mention you're interested in VPC early access. Include your use case, IBM Cloud account ID, and linked infrastructure account ID.

To find your account ID: In the IBM Cloud console, click **Manage > Account**. Then, click **Account settings** in the navigation pane.
{: tip}

The following [terms](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/cloud/bluemix/network/vpc/beta_agreement_for_use.pdf){: new_window}, including the terms applicable to your IBM Cloud Account apply to your participation in this early access program.

## Program conditions

By participating in the early access program, you agree to the following conditions:

* Limit use to functionality testing: no scale, performance, load, or pressure testing.
* Provide feedback so we can improve the offering.
* Abide by the [quotas](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-quotas#quotas). 
* Agree to the current limitations. There is no Service Level Agreement during the early access program and any resources created are not guaranteed to be available when the offering becomes generally available.
* Experimental use only: As features are deployed during the early access timeframe, any or all of your work could be lost with short notice. At the end of the early access program, the resources you've created will not be available and can't be migrated.
 
### Service Level Agreement (SLA)

This release does not have an SLA. All issues are handled as **minor severity** with next business day response. 

We will inform you _one week before_ the early access program closes. When the early access program is over, your configuration and data within the environment will be deleted.
