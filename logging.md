# Logging for VPC
{: #logging}

After you provision {{site.data.keyword.la_full}} to add log management capabilities to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} architecture, you can enable platform logs to view and analyze VPC logs.
{: shortdesc}

## Platform logs
{: #logging_ov}

Platform logs are logs that are exposed by logging-enabled services and the platform in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You must configure a {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance in a region to monitor these logs.

For more information, see [Configuring IBM Cloud platform logs](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-config_svc_logs).

## Viewing logs
{: #logging_view}

VPC services generate platform logs in the same region where they are available. You can view, monitor, and manage VPC logs through the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance that is marked as **platform logs** in the region.

To launch the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} web UI to view these logs, see [Navigating to the web UI](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-launch).

For information about the locations where VPC logs are available, see [VPC infrastructure services locations](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-cloud_services_locations#cloud_services_locations_vpc_infrastructure).

## Fields per log type
{: #logging_fields}

Table 1 outlines the fields that are included in each log record:

| Field             | Type       | Description             |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| `logSourceCRN`    | Required   | Defines the account and flow log instance where the log is published. |
| `saveServiceCopy` | Required   | Defines whether IBM saves a copy of the record for operational purposes. |
| `message`         | Required   | Description of the log that is generated. |
| `messageID`       | Required   | ID of the log that is generated. |
| `msg_timestamp`   | Required   | The timestamps when the log is generated. |
| `resolution`      | Optional   | Guidance on how to proceed if you receive this log record. |
| `documentsURL`    | Optional   | More information on how to proceed if you receive this log record. |
| `generation`      | Required   | Defines the VPC source of the log. Valid options are `1` for VPC Classic, and `2` for `VPC Gen 2`. |

## Log messages
{: #logging_msgs}

The following tables list the message IDs that are generated by VPC services:

### Flow log collector
{: #logging-flow-log-collector_msgs}

Table 2 outlines the message IDs that are generated by the flow log collector service:

| Message ID                     | Type  | Learn More  |
