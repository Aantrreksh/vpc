# Bandwidth allocation for instance profiles
{: #bandwidth-allocation-profiles}

Instance profiles inform the available instance bandwidth of an instance.
{: shortdesc}

## Bandwidth allocation for resources attached to an instance
{: #attached-resources}

When you provision an instance, the total instance bandwidth is allocated between attached volumes and networking. The maximum bandwidth capacity is determined by the [instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=ui) that you select during instance provisioning. For example, a bx2-2x8 balanced server profile allows a total instance bandwidth of 4,000 Mbps (4 Gbps). The default allocation is 25% for volumes, 75% for networking. In this case:

* Volumes: 1,000 Mbps
* Network: 3,000 Mbps

The MaxBandwidth property of a volume is the highest potential bandwidth that may be allocated to the volume when attached to an instance. The IOPS limit is always set to the maximum IOPS of the volume. In cases where the total MaxBandwidth of attached volumes exceeds the amount available on the instance, the bandwidth for each attached volume will be set proportionally based on the volume MaxBandwidth.

To ensure reasonable boot times, a minimum of 393 Mbps of volume bandwidth is allocated to the boot volume. In the example where the instance's total volume bandwidth is 1,000 Mbps, the remaining 607 Mbps is allocated to any secondary volumes that you attach, up to the maximum bandwidth of the volume. For example, if you have one data volume with 500 Mbps, you can expect to get that level of performance.

## Adjusting bandwidth allocation

The allocation of the instance's total bandwidth can be adjusted after provisioning, balancing between network bandwidth and volume bandwidth, but both volume and network bandwidth must be at least 500 Mbps each. Before you make any change to the volume/networking bandwidth ratio, be sure to evaluate your instance's network bandwidth requirements. Make sure the new bandwidth allocation will not have negative effects on your instanceâ€™s network performance.

For example, to allow more volume bandwidth, you could apportion the above example in equal allocations:

* Volumes: 2,000 Mb/s
* Network: 2,000 Mb/s

The volume bandwidth available to the instance is apportioned on a per-volume basis. The bandwidth is assigned per volume, not shared between volumes. For example, if you have four identical volumes attached to an instance but are only using one volume, then that volume can get only the bandwidth assigned to it. The volume in use can't access extra bandwidth that is assigned to the unused volumes.

<!--Customers will have the ability to modify the amount provided to volume bandwidth within the overall instance limits. A default amount of volume bandwidth will be set on each instance profile.
1Gbps-2Gbps per-vCPU with a limit of 80Gbps-->

## Example balanced profiles for x86_64 processors
{: #balanced-x86-profiles-example}

The following Balanced profiles are available for x86_64 processors:

| Instance profile | vCPU | GiB RAM | Bandwidth Cap (Gbps) | Instance Storage (GB) |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| bx2-2x8 | 2 | 8 | 4 | - |
| bx2d-2x8 | 2 | 8 | 4 | 1x75 |
| bx2-4x16 | 4 | 16 | 8 | - |
| bx2d-4x16 | 4 | 16 | 8 | 1x150 |
| bx2-8x32 | 8 | 32 | 16 | - |
| bx2d-8x32 | 8 | 32 | 16 | 1x300 |
| bx2-16x64 | 16 | 64 | 32 | - |
| bx2d-16x64 | 16 | 64 | 32 | 1x600 |

Most profiles have a bandwidth cap of 2 Gbps per vCPU and Ultra high memory profiles have a cap of 1 Gbps per vCPU. The total instance bandwidth cap is 80 Gbps. Network bandwidth is distributed evenly across network interfaces, and each network interface has a cap of 16 Gbps that might limit the overall performance. You might need to attach multiple network interfaces to your virtual server instance to optimize network performance.

For example, if you choose a profile with 16 vCPUs, the bandwidth cap for the profile is 32 Gbps, 24 Gbps of which is assigned to networking. If you have just one network interface, the maximum network performance is 16 Gbps due to the network interface cap. You need to attach two network interfaces (12 Gbps each) to reach the profile cap of 24 Gbps.

For more information, see [Instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=ui).

<!-- Do we want to communicate this?
<!-- The 2Gbps per-vCPU is a maximum allocation for an instance. The actual allocation of networking bandwidth to an instance is determined by the number of attached vNICs. The maximum allocation for each vNIC is provided on the instance profile and for all existing profiles is 16Gb/s. This means that if only 1 vNIC is attached at-most 16Gb/s is allocated to the instance. -->
