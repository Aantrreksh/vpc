### Where do I find cost estimates for a Private Path service?
{: #pricing-private-path}
{: faq}
{: support}

 Private Path services and Virtual Private Endpoint (VPE) gateways are free services. A Private Path network load balancer is charged for usage per gigabyte. To estimate the cost of a load balancer, use the cost estimator on the provisioning page (either when you create a Private Path network load balancer during [Private Path service creation](/vpc-ext/provision/privatePathService), or from the [Load balancers page](/vpc-ext/network/loadBalancers)). For example, from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) from the upper left and select **VPC Infrastructure > Private Path services**. Then, click **Create** to open the provisioning page.
