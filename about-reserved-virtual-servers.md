# About Reservations for VPC
{: #about-reserved-virtual-servers-vpc}

[Select availability]{: tag-green}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Reservations are a great option when you want significant cost savings and guaranteed resources for future deployments. You can choose a 1 or 3-year term, server quantity, specific profile, and provision those servers when needed.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Reservations are available in only the US South (Dallas), US East (Washington DC), Brazil (SÃ£o Paulo), Canada (Toronto), United Kingdom (London), EU Germany (Frankfurt), Spain (Madrid), Japan (Osaka), Japan (Tokyo), and Australia (Sydney) multizone regions (MZRs).
{: note}

Reservations offer many advantages, including the following benefits:

| Benefit | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Cost savings | Save up to 60% by choosing a 1 or 3-year term compared to on-demand virtual server billing cycles. |
| Guaranteed capacity | Your servers are there when you need them. {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Reservations are guaranteed capacity within the availability zone and data center of your choice for the life of your committed term. |
| Predictable management | Accurately plan for the future and define your budgeting roadmap with reserved capacity for 1-year or 3-year terms. Your reserved pricing is a fixed discount rate that is applied to the corresponding virtual server profile on-demand rates that are listed in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} portal. |
| Flexibility in deployment | Convert any existing on-demand virtual server to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Reservation billing. Attach or detach any compatible virtual server to your reservation. |

## Limitations
{: #limitations-reserved-virtual-servers-vpc}

Consider the following limitations before you provision a reservation and provision a virtual server within that reservation.

* You can't resize a virtual server that's in a reservation.
* Reservations comply with the VPC quotas and service limits. For more information, see [Quotas and service limits](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-quotas).
* SGX isn't supported.

## Notifications
{: #notifications-reserved-virtual-servers-vpc}

When your reservation is complete, a confirmation message is sent.

You receive a [notification](https://cloud.ibm.com/user/notifications){: external} before the end of the term of your reservation. From here, you can decide whether to renew your reservation or cancel.

If **Auto-renew** is selected when you provision a reservation, your reservation automatically renews when it expires.
