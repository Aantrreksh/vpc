{: requirement}

## Viewing backup policies from the CLI
{: #backup-view-cli}
{: cli}

You can view backup policies by using the CLI.

### Before you begin
{: #backup-view-cli-prereq}

Before you can use the CLI, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in. For more information, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).
{: requirement}

1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.

   ```sh
   ibmcloud login --sso -a cloud.ibm.com
   ```
   {: pre}

   This command returns a URL and prompts for a passcode. Go to that URL in your browser and log in. If successful, you get a one-time passcode. Copy this passcode and paste it as a response on the prompt. After successful authentication, you are prompted to choose your account. If you have access to multiple accounts, select the account that you want to log in as. Respond to any remaining prompts to finish logging in.

2. Select the current generation of VPC.

   ```sh
   ibmcloud is target --gen 2
   ```
   {: pre}

### Listing all backup policies from the CLI
{: #backup-view-all-cli}

Run the `backup-policies` command to list all backup policies that you created in your account and region.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policies [--tag TAG_NAME] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID | --resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME | --all-resource-groups] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

The following example shows the output that you can expect.

```sh
cloudshell:~$ ibmcloud is backup-policies
Listing backup policies in all resource groups and region eu-de under account Test Account as user test.user@ibm.com...
ID                                          Name                  Status   Resource group

```
{: screen}

For more information about available command options, see [`ibmcloud is backup-policies`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#backup-policies).

### Listing all backup policies filter by user tags from the CLI
{: #backup-view-all-filter-by-tags-cli}

Run the `backup-policies` command to list all backup policies that you created in your account and region. The `--tag` option filters the collection of backup policies with the exact user tag value.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policies --tag
```
{: pre}

The following example produces a list of backup policies that have the `dev:test` tag.

```text
cloudshell:~$ ibmcloud is backup-policies --tag dev:test
Listing backup policies in all resource groups and region eu-de under account Test Account as user test.userd@ibm.com...

### Listing all plans for a backup policy with the API
{: #backup-view-plans-api}

Make a `GET /backup_policies/{backup_policy_id}/plans` request to list the plans that are associated with a backup policy. You can have up to four plans per policy. See the following example.

```curl
curl -X GET\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/fb721535-2cc6-45d6-ade7-3ceb95b7f26f/plans?version=2022-12-16&generation=2"\
   -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

A successful response looks like the following example.

```json

      "resource_type": "backup_policy_plan"
    }
  ]
}
```
{: codeblock}

To retrieve information about a single plan, specify the plan ID in the request:

```curl
curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/{backup_policy_id}/plans/{plan_id}?version=2022-12-16&generation=2"
```
{: codeblock}

## Retrieving a backup plan with the fast restore option
{: #baas-view-plan-fast-restore}
{: api}

You can see information about the zone in which fast restore backup snapshots are being created and the number of snapshots in each zone.

Make a `GET /backup_policy/{backup_policy_id}/plans/{plan_id}` call. In the response, the `clone_policy` property shows the zone in which the snapshot clone for fast restore is created and the maximum number of recent snapshots per volume that keeps clones.

You can also retrieve all plans for a backup policy and view plans you set up for backup snapshot clones. For more information, see the [List all plans for a backup policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-backup-policy-plans) in the API reference.
{: note}

Example call:

```curl
curl -X GET\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/fb721535-2cc6-45d6-ade7-3ceb95b7f26f/plan/4d58eb08-d950-498b-8175-b4d617b6ba6a?version=2022-12-16&generation=2"\
?version=2022-06-03&generation=2"
   -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

The response shows the clone policy information. In this example, clones are created for snapshots in us-south-2 with a maximum of two clones per snapshot to be kept.

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "attach_user_tags": [
    "my-plan-2"
  ],
  "clone_policy": {
  "max_snapshots": 2,
  "zones": [
    {
      "name": "us-south-2"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://us-south.iaas.cloud.ibm.com/v1/regions/us-south/zones/us-south-1"

## Retrieving a backup plan with the cross-regional copy option
{: #baas-view-plan-crc}
{: api}

[New]{: tag-new}

Make a `GET /backup_policy/{backup_policy_id}/plans/{plan_id}` call. In the response, the `remote_region_policies` property shows the remote region where a copy of the backup is created.

See the following example.

```curl
curl -X GET\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/fb721535-2cc6-45d6-ade7-3ceb95b7f26f/plan/4d58eb08-d950-498b-8175-b4d617b6ba6a?version=2023-05-09&generation=2"\
?version=2023-05-09&generation=2"
   -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

The response shows the remote region policy information. In this example, the output shows that when the backup job creates a backup snapshot in the `us-south` region, a copy of the backup is created in the `us-east` region, too.

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "attach_user_tags": [
    "hourly-backups"

## Viewing backup policies and plans with Terraform
{: #backup-view-terraform}
{: terraform}

You can use Terraformm to view backup policies and plans.

To use Terraform, download the Terraform CLI and configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in. For more information, see [Getting started with Terraform](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started).
{: requirement}

VPC infrastructure services use a regional specific based endpoint, which targets to `us-south` by default. If your VPC is created in another region, make sure to target the right region in the provider block in the `provider.tf` file.

See the following example of targeting a region other than the default `us-south`.

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-de"
}
```
