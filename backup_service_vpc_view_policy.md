# Viewing backup policies
{: #backup-view-policies}

You can list and view all backup policies that you created for your {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes in the console, from the CLI, or with the API. You can review the details of individual policies.
{: shortdesc}

## View backup policies in the UI
{: #backup-view-ui}

List all backup policies and view details of a specific policy.

### List all backup policies in the UI
{: #backup-list-all-policies}

List all backup policies that you created for volumes in your account for the selected region.

In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to the **menu ![menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Backup policies**. By default, the Overview tab is selected.

### View a list of volumes that have a backup policy
{: #backup-view-vol-backup-policies}

View a list of {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes that are backed up by the policy. For a volume to be backed up by a policy, the volume must be tagged with at least one of the policyâ€™s tags for the target resources.

Look at which {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes have policies and verify that the policies are correctly applied.

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to the **menu ![menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Backup policies**.

2. Click a policy name.

3. Click the **Applied resources** tab.

A list of {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes that are backed up by this policy is shown. Information about the volumes includes the volume name, status, volume size, and encryption type (see Table 3).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Name of the volume. Click the pencil icon to edit. |
| Status | [Status of the volume](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-block-storage#status). |
| Size | Size of the volume in GBs.|
| Encryption | [IBM-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about#vpc-provider-managed-encryption) or [customer-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about#vpc-customer-managed-encryption). |
| Add volume | Add a volume to this policy. The informational side panel provides a list of tags for target resources that you can apply to the volume, and a link to the [list of {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-viewing-block-storage&interface=ui#viewvols-ui). You must apply at least one of the policy's tags for target resources to the volume. |
{: caption="Table 3. List of {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes for the backup policy" caption-side="top"}

You can also view a more detailed list of all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes in your account region, including user tags that are applied to the volume. For more information, see [View information about all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes in the UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-viewing-block-storage&interface=ui#viewvols-ui).

When you click a volume name to see the details, you need administrator privileges to access the information.

## View backup policies from the CLI
{: #backup-view-cli}
{: cli}

### List all backup policies from the CLI
{: #backup-view-all-cli}

Run the `backup-policies` command to list all backup policies that you created in your account and region.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policies [--tag TAG_NAME] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID | --resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME | --all-resource-groups] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

The following example shows the output that you can expect.

```sh
$ ibmcloud is backup-policies

Listing backup policies in all resource groups and region us-south under account vpcdemo as user myuser.mycompany.com...
ID                                     Name                          Status    Resource group

### List all backup policies filter by user tags from the CLI
{: #backup-view-all-filter-by-tags-cli}

Run the `backup-policies` command to list all backup policies that you created in your account and region. The `--tag` parameter filters the collection of backup policies with the exact user tag value.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policies --tag
```
{: pre}

The following example produces a list of backup policies that have the `dev:test` tag.

```text

### View backup policy details from the CLI
{: #backup-view-details-cli}

Run the `backup-policy` command and specify either the backup policy ID or the policy name. 

```text
ibmcloud is backup-policy POLICY [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]

To retrieve information about a single plan, specify the plan ID in the request:

```curl
curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/{backup_policy_id}/plans/{plan_id}?version=2022-12-16&generation=2"
```
{: codeblock}


## Retrieve a backup plan with the fast restore option
{: #baas-view-plan-fast-restore}

You can see information about the zone in which fast restore backup snapshots are being created and the number of snapshots in each zone.

Make a `GET /backup_policy/{backup_policy_id}/plans/{plan_id}` call. In the response, the `clone_policy` property shows the zone in which the snapshot clone for fast restore is created and the maximum number of recent snapshots per volume that keeps clones.

You can also retrieve all plans for a backup policy and view plans you set up for backup snapshot clones. For more information, see the [List all plans for a backup policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-backup-policy-plans) in the API reference.
{: note}

Example call:

```curl

?version=2022-06-03&generation=2"
   -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
