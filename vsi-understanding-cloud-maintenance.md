# Understanding cloud maintenance operations
{: #about-cloud-maintenance}

## Types of maintenance operations that affect your virtual server instances
{: #types-of-maintenance}

### Host maintenance
{: #types-of-maintenance-host}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} performs periodic maintenance on the underlying server hosts that run virtual servers. This maintenance can be upgrades to the software on the underlying hypervisor, updates to the firmware on the systems or other security and performance updates. In general, users don't experience any issues during these upgrades. Modifications that require host maintenance are, in most cases, which are applied with no or little impact to running services. Some infrequent scenarios can occur where the user might need to be involved during those operations, which are discussed in the [possible impacts]({: #maintenance-impacts}) section.

### Data center maintenance
{: #types-of-maintenance-data-center}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} also performs periodic data center maintenance upgrades. Users don't generally experience any issues during data center maintenance. Examples of this maintenance can be updates to the network, power infrastructure, or server hardware in a data center. Most maintenance is performed without impact to the userâ€™s workloads. Some infrequent scenarios can occur where the user might need to be involved during those operations, which are discussed in the following section.

## Possible impacts to virtual server instances during maintenance operations
{: #maintenance-impacts}

Most updates are done transparently to the host and the virtual servers that run on those hosts do not see any disruption. Non-disruptive changes can occur multiple times per week or even daily if necessary, all without impacting the user experience.

Some of these changes might require that a virtual server needs to be live migrated to resolve an underlying issue on the hypervisor or host, such as a firmware update or a rare event where we can't live patch the hypervisor kernel. When live migration occurs, the virtual server experiences a brief pause of around 10 seconds, and in some cases up to 30 seconds. The virtual server instance is not restarted as part of this process.

In limited cases, a virtual server restart might be required to complete the host or data center maintenance. This scenario can occur when specialized VMs are used, such as virtual servers with Instance Storage, or if the virtual server encounters a migration problem. In this case, a scheduled maintenance event occurs.

## What to expect during a scheduled maintenance event
{: #about-scheduled-maintenance}

In this rare case, the account owner is emailed about the upcoming maintenance that requires their attention. The account owner is given a maintenance period during which they need to power-off their virtual server and then power it back on. This procedure causes the virtual machine to start on updated infrastructure.  

When virtual servers are restarted, customer data and configuration are restored. However, if specialty virtual server types such as instance storage, the ephemeral data isn't restored. 

Advanced notice is given for the maintenance window. For more information about for details on advanced notice for disruptive maintenance, see [IBM Cloud Notifications](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-viewing-notifications). If the user takes no action before the maintenance window, the virtual server restarts during the maintenance window on their behalf.
