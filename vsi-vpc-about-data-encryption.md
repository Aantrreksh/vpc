# About data encryption for VPC
{: #vpc-encryption-about}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} takes security seriously and understands the importance of encrypting data to keep it safe. When you create a standalone data volume or create a data volume as part of instance provisioning, your data is encrypted by default using IBM-managed encryption. You can extend protection by using customer-managed encryption. Customer-managed encryption let's you bring your own keys to the cloud and then use your root key to secure your data. You retain complete control over your data.

## IBM-managed encryption
{: #vpc-provider-managed-encryption}

By default, all boot and data volumes are encrypted at rest with IBM provider-managed encryption. There is no additional cost for this service or impact on performance. Provider-managed encryption uses the following industry standard protocols:

* AES-256 encryption
* Keys are managed in-house with Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)
* Storage is validated for Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Storage is also validated for Payment Card Industry (PCI), Basel II, California Security Breach Information Act (SB 1386), and EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC compliance.

## Customer-managed encryption
{: #vpc-customer-managed-encryption}

With customer-managed encryption, you provision customer root keys (CRKs) to protect your encrypted resources in the cloud. Root keys serve as key-wrapping keys that safeguard LUKS passphrases.  You decide whether to import your existing root keys ("bring your own key"), or have a supported IBM key management service (KMS) create one for you. 

Block storage volumes are assigned a unique master encryption key generated by the instance's host hypervisor. The master key for each volume is encrypted with a unique KMS-generated LUKS passphrase, which is then encrypted by the CRK and stored in the KMS. 

You can choose {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} (HPCS) as your KMS. Both provide envelope encryption, which wraps your secret passphrase with your CRK and creates a wrapped data encryption key (WDEK). Root keys in HPCS service instances are also protected by a hardware security module (HSM) master key. The KMS stores your key and makes it available during volume and custom image encryption. You also manage your keys in the KMS. For more information, see [Supported key management services for customer-managed encryption](#kms-for-byok).

After provisioning the key management service, you must authorize access between Cloud Block Storage (source service) and the KMS.

Customer-managed encryption is available for both boot and data volumes. You can configure customer-managed encryption for volumes when you provision a virtual server instance or when you create a standalone volume.

### Advantages of customer-managed encryption
{: #byok-advantages}

Customer-managed encryption gives you the following advantages over provider-managed encryption:

* Encryption keys are controlled by you. You grant IBM access to use your root keys to encrypt your data.
* Data is encrypted while in transit and while at rest.
* You can encrypt boot and data volumes.
* You choose the [key management service (KMS)](#kms-for-byok) you want to use. You can select {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, a public multi-tenant KMS that is FIPS 140-2 L3 compliant, or the more secure {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}, which is FIPS 140-2 L4 compliant.
* Customer-managed encryption provides better audit records for key usage. Your key access is logged in the [Activity Tracker](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-managing#byok-activity-tracker-events) with LogDNA service. The Activity Tracker lets you track interactions with the VPC.

### IBM's encryption technology - How your data is secured
{: #byok-technologies}

Encryption is handled by IBM's host/hypervisor technology for your instances. This feature provides greater level of security over solutions that only provide storage node encryption. Data is always encrypted with your root key outside the host/hypervisor. This means that your data is protected while in transit between the host system and IBM's storage systems, and while at rest in IBM's storage system.

Communication between the host system and IBM's storage systems is also encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology using IBM-managed keys. This means when your data is in transit, it's encrypted twice; first with your AES-256 master encryption key and then with IBM's TLS encryption key.

For more information about technologies used for customer-managed encryption, see [Data security and encryption questions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-faq#block-storage-vpc-security-questions) in the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} FAQs.

### Root key regional and cross-regional considerations
{: #byok-cross-region-keys}

Customer-managed encryption lets you keep your root keys in the same region as your resources, or in a different region (cross-regional). 

When you use root keys in the same region as your resources, all network traffic is directed to a private endpoint. That is, your keys encrypt and decrypt resources over a private network that's inaccessible to the Internet. In contrast, when your keys are in a different region than your resource, the key material must transmit over a public network, exposing it to the Internet.

Cross-regional keys offer more key availability with the tradeoff of slightly higher latency. You can create and manage root keys in one region and apply them to resources in another region. Cross-regional keys are available in the US, EU, and AP regions.

As best practice, use root keys in the same region as your resources. Regional service uses private endpoints to multiple availability zones. If a given zone is unavailable, you can continue to access your root keys and encrypted resources from another zone.

## Supported key management services for customer-managed encryption
{: #kms-for-byok}

Two IBM key management services (KMS) are available for customer-managed encyryption, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} and {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} (available in certain [regions](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-regions#regions)). These services use a common key provider API to provide a consistent approach for managing your encryption keys. 

Table 1 describes these services:

| Key Management Service | HSM Encryption Certification | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| [{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/key-protect/concepts?topic=key-protect-getting-started-tutorial) | FIPS 140-2 *Level 3* compliance | A multi-tenant KMS that lets you import or create your root keys and securely manage them.  |
| [{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-get-started) | FIPS 140-2 *Level 4* compliance | Highest level of security; a single-tenant KMS and hardware security module (HSM) that's controlled by you.  Import or create your root keys and securely manage them. Create a HSM master key to encrypt the content of key storage, including root keys. Only you have access to your keys and data. |

## General procedure for setting up customer-managed encryption
{: #byok-general-prodedure}
Setting up customer-managed encryption for your block storage volumes involves several steps. Here's the general procedure:

1. Generate your own root key from your on-premises HSM. Optionally, create your root key by using an IBM Cloud HSM or use {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}, which includes an HSM.
1. Provision the key management service that best meets your needs.
1. Use your KMS to securely import your root key to the cloud service. For added security, create an import token in your KMS to encrypt and import root keys to the service. 
1. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers provide a dedicated HSM to create and protect your keys. Using {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}, you can take control of your cloud data encryption keys and cloud hardware security module.
1. From IBM {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM), authorize service between **Cloud Block Storage** (source service) and your KMS (target service).
1. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure uses your root key to secure the data by wrapping the passphrases for your resources.
1. Manage your keys in your KMS. For example, you can disable your root key to ensure that the IBM-managed keys' associated data can [no longer be accessed or decrypted](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-managing#instance-byok-inaccessible-data).

## Flow diagrams for specifying customer-managed encryption
{: #byok-options}

You can specify customer-managed encryption when you create a new block storage volume during instance provisioning. You can also specify it when you create a volume outside instance provisioning.

Figure 1 shows the end-to-end procedure for creating a data volume with customer-managed encryption during instance provisioning. The volume is automatically attached to the instance.
