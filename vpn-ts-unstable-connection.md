If you notice that your connection is going up and down occasionally, it might be due to a rekey timing issue.
{: shortdesc}

My connection is not stable and keeps going down.
{: tsSymptoms}

There might be a rekey timing conflict.  
{: tsCauses}

Follow the steps to resolve any timing issues:
{: tsResolve}

1. Make sure NAT-Traversal is enabled on the peer, if it is a configurable option.
1. If you are using IKEv2, try using different lifetimes so that the side with the shorter lifetime always initiates the rekeying process.Â 
1. Try disabling and re-enabling the connection.
