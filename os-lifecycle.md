# Lifecycle for guest operating systems
{: #guest-os-lifecycle}

In the lifecycle of an operating system, end of support (EOS) is the last date that {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} delivers standard support for a version or release of a product. The end of support date is aligned to the vendor and community support dates. It is also the effective date that the product ceases to exist (is deprecated) and can no longer be ordered or purchased.
{: shortdesc}

A stock image starts out in available status. When a newer version of the image becomes available, the status of the older image changes to deprecated. A deprecated image can still be used to provision a virtual server instance, but such use is discouraged. If an image moves to obsolete status, such as when the image operating system reaches EOS, it can't be used to provision new virtual server instances.

## Viewing the image lifecycle of a stock image by using the UI
{: #image-lifecycle-ui}
{: ui}

You can list all of the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} stock images in your region that are in available status by going to **Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Compute > Images**. Click the **Stock Images** tab to see all the available stock images. Images that are in deprecated status are not shown.

## Viewing the image lifecycle of a stock image by using the CLI
{: #image-lifecycle-cli}
{: cli}

You can list all of the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} stock images in your region by using the command-line interface (CLI).

To list all stock images by using the CLI, use the **ibmcloud is images** command. Stock images are public, so the `--visibility` option is `public`.

```sh
ibmcloud is images --visibility public
```
{: pre}

## Viewing the image lifecycle of a stock image by using the API
{: #image-lifecycle-api}
{: api}

You can list all of the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} stock images in your region by using the application programming interface (API).

Stock images are public, so you can set the `visibility` property to `public` to retrieve only stock images.

```sh
curl -X GET \
”$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/images?version=2022-11-21&generation=2&visibility=public" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token"
```
