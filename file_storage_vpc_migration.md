# `2023-05-30` API migration (file shares)
{: #2023-05-30-migration-file-shares}

As described in the [Beta VPC API](/apidocs/vpc-beta) reference [versioning](/apidocs/vpc-beta#api-versioning-beta) policy, to more quickly respond to feedback as a feature progresses through its beta phase, support for older versions of the beta API is limited to 45 days. Therefore, beta API requests must specify a `version` query parameter date value within the last 45 days.

Before adopting beta release version `2023-05-30` or later, be aware of the following changes which may require you to update your client:

- In the [Shares](/apidocs/vpc-beta#list-share-profiles) methods, the `targets` property has been changed to `mount_targets`.
- In the [share mount targets](/apidocs/vpc-beta#list-share-mount-targets) methods, the `resource_type` property value has been changed to `share_mount_target`.
- When [creating](/apidocs/vpc-beta#create-share) a file share, you must specify the `mount_targets` property instead of the `targets` property
- When making [share mount targets](/apidocs/vpc-beta#list-share-mount-targets) method requests, you must use the method URL `/shares/{id}/mount_targets` instead of `/shares/{id}/targets`.

All requests using the following methods will enforce the existing requirement that you provide the [`maturity=beta`](/apidocs/vpc-beta#maturity-query-parameter) query parameter:

- [Create a file share](/apidocs/vpc-beta#create-share)
- [Create a mount target for a file share](/apidocs/vpc-beta#create-share-mount-target)
- [List all file shares](/apidocs/vpc-beta#list-shares)
- [Retrieve a file share](/apidocs/vpc-beta#get-share)
- [List all mount targets for a file share](/apidocs/vpc-beta#list-share-mount-targets)
- [Retrieve a share mount target](/apidocs/vpc-beta#get-share-mount-target)
- [Retrieve the source file share for a replica share](/apidocs/vpc-beta#get-share-source)
- [Update a file share](/apidocs/vpc-beta#update-share)
- [Update a share mount target](/apidocs/vpc-beta#update-share-mount-target)
- [Delete a file share](/apidocs/vpc-beta#delete-share)
- [Delete a share mount target](/apidocs/vpc-beta#delete-share-mount-target)

## Action needed
{: #action-needed-mount-target}

Before specifying `version` query parameter of `2023-05-30` or later, follow these actions to avoid regressions in client functionality.

### Client migration
{: #client-migration-mount-target}

Before migrating a client to API version `2023-05-30` or later, review your code for use of the `targets` property. Change all instances of `targets` to `mount_targets` in the manner appropriate for your programming language. Changes are required in all relevant request paths, as well as request and response JSON field name formats. For more information, see the [Beta API change log](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-api-change-log-beta##version-2023-05-30-beta).

## Examples
{: #examples-mount-target}

These examples compare differences between before and after the `2023-05-30` versioned change. All requests that use a `version` query parameter of `2023-05-30` or later must use `/shares/{share_id}/mount_targets` (instead of `/shares/{share_id}/targets`) in the request URL.

### Listing a file share and mount targets
{: #migration-list-share-examples}

The following examples compare how to make a request to list a file share and mount targets before and after the `2023-05-30` versioned change. The path of the API request is different before and after the change.

This request lists a file share and mount targets, specifying API version `2023-05-29` or earlier. The path of the API request includes `/targets`.

```sh
curl -X GET \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/{share_id}/targets?version=2023-05-29&generation=2&maturity=beta"\
-H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token"\
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Creating a file share and mount target

The following examples compare how to make a request to create a file share and mount target before and after the `2023-05-30` versioned change. The path of the API request is the same before and after the property change, however the data section changes with the new `mount_targets` property.

This request creates a file share and target, specifying API version `2023-05-29` or earlier. The `targets` property is specified in the example.

```sh
