# Creating backup policies and plans
{: #backup-policy-create}

You can create backup policies for your {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes in the UI, from the CLI, or with the API. You can create up to four backup plans to schedule backup creation and retention. Specify user tags in the policy to ensure that your data is backed up regularly. Create backups on schedule when the tags that are applied to a volume match tags in a backup policy.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #backup-prereqs}

1. Establish IAM user roles to grant [service-to-service authorizations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-s2s-auth) so the backup service can detect volume tags and create backups.

2. Create user tags for new or existing data volumes that you can associate with a backup policy. For more information about adding tags, see [Apply tags to resources for backup policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-use-policies). For more information about creating tags, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag).

## Create a backup policy and plan in the UI
{: #backup-policy-create-ui}
{: ui}

### Create a backup policy in the UI
{: #backup-provisioning-page-ui}

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to the **menu ![menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Storage > Backup policies**. The **Create** tab is selected by default.

   Optionally, from the [list of all backup policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-view-policies&interface=ui#backup-list-all-policies), click **Create**.

2. Enter information for each section of the provisioning form. Create at least one backup plan per policy.

   | Field        | Description |
   |--------------|-------------|
   | **Location** | Select the location in which you want to create the backup policy. |
   | - Geography  | Select the appropriate value from the list of available geographies. |
   | - Region     | Select the appropriate value from the list of available regions in the selected geography. |
   | **Details**  | Enter details to define the policy. A policy defines what volumes are backed up. |
   | - Name       | Provide a unique name for your backup policy that easily identifies the policy. Standard naming conventions apply to policies, plans, and backups. For example, see these [snapshots naming conventions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-manage&interface=ui#snapshots-vpc-naming). |
   | - Resource group| Optionally, specify a resource group for your policy. It can't be changed after you enter it.  \n For more information, see [Best practices for organizing resources in a resource group](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup). |
   | - Tags        | Add user tags that you want to apply to this policy. This tag must match a {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume tag. |
   | - Access management tags | Access management tags are used to manage access to resources, and they can be created in advance for use in access policies. Access policies control access to the resources where the tags are attached. Only the account administrator can create access management tag. |
   | **Tags for target resources** | Specify the user tags to apply to your target resources ({{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes) in your region. If multiple resources use the same tag, backups are created for all tagged resources. If a resource has multiple tags, it only needs to match one tag that is associated with the backup policy. After the backup policy is created, existing resources with any of the tags for target resources are automatically associated. |
   | **Plan**         | Click **Create** to create backup plans for this policy. In the side panel, specify the plan details. When finished, click **Create**. The page refreshes with a summary of the plan details. You can create up to four backup plans. All apply to the volumes with tags that match the backup policy. \n For more information about options, see [Specify a backup plan](#backup-plan-ui). |
   {: caption="Table 1. Backup policy provisioning selections" caption-side="bottom"}

3. Optionally, [estimate the costs](#backup-cost-estimator-ui) for your backups.

4. Click **Create backup policy**. The order summary side panel shows the backup policy and all plans that were created for it.


### Specify a backup plan in the UI
{: #backup-plan-ui}

You can schedule backups in your plan on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis by using predefined settings, or by way of a `cron-spec` expression. These steps continue from [Creating a backup policy](#backup-policy-create-ui) and describe the backup plan side panel.

#### Specify a backup plan by predefined intervals
{: #backup-automated-plan-ui}

1. From the Plan side panel, enter a name for the plan (for example, _daily-dallas-vol1_). The plan name must be unique within the policy.

2. Under **Frequency**, select Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.

   * For a Daily plan, enter the **starting time (UTC)** in hours and minutes, UTC. For example, 12 noon would be 12:00. Local time conversion is automatically provided, for example, 12 PM Central Daylight Time.

   * For a Weekly plan, select the days of the week you want backups to execute. For example, you could select Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Specify the starting time in the same manner as a Daily plan.

   * For a Monthly plan, select the day of the month you want backups to execute. For example, 1 would schedule a backup every first of the month. Specify the starting time in the same manner as a Daily plan.

   The **Backup destination** shows the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume's region. The **Backup resource group** is the resource group that is associated with the volume.
   {: note}

3. Specify a **Retention type** for the backups. You can specify either how long to keep them by number of days or the total number to retain.

   * For **Age**, specify the number of days that you want to retain the backups. There is no default for the maximum number of days to keep a backup.

   * For **Count**, provide the number of backups that you want to keep. You can retain up to 750 snapshots for a volume. 
   
   To keep costs down, set a retention period or backup snapshot count adequate to your needs. For example, setting 7 for **Age** retains a week's worth of backups.

4. Under **Optional configurations**, **Tagging**, specify more tags that apply to the backup when the plan executes.
   * Select the box to copy all tags from the source volume to all backups.
   * Under **Tags for backups**, manually any extra plan tags in this field.

5. **Summary** information updates automatically with the selections that you made. For example, the plan might be "Every Monday at -5:53 UTC (12:30 AM CDT) starting on March 26, 2022." The **Plan status** toggle is enabled by default.

6. Click **Create** to save the new plan. The list of plans is updated in the policy details page. If you want to make any changes, click the pencil icon for that plan. If you want to delete the plan, click the delete icon.

#### Specify a backup plan by using a CRON expression
{: #backup-cron-plan-ui}

You can specify a backup plan to indicate frequency by way of a `cron-spec` expression. Based on the size of the volume that you want to back up, do not create a backup under an hour by using a `cron-spec` expression.

1. From the Plan side panel, enter a name for the plan. For example, _daily-dallas-vol1_.

2. Under **Frequency**, select **Specify by using cron expression** from the drop down menu.
   * Under **Cron expression {UTC)**, enter the backup creation frequency in `cron-spec` format: minute, hour, day, month, and weekday. For example, to create a backup every day at 5:30 PM, you need to enter `30 17 * * *`.

   * The **Backup destination** shows the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume's region. The **Backup resource group** is the resource group that is associated with the volume.

3. Specify a **Retention type** for the backups. You can specify either how long to keep them by number of days or the total number to retain.

   * For **Age**, specify the number of days that you want to retain the backups. There is no default for the maximum number of days to keep a backup.
   * For **Count**, provide the number of backups that you want to keep. You can retain up to 750 snapshots for a volume. 
   
   To keep costs down, set a retention period or backup snapshot count adequate to your needs. For example, setting 7 for **Age** retains a week's worth of backups.

4. Under **Optional configurations**, **Tagging**, specify more tags that apply to the backup when the plan executes.
   * Select the box to copy all tags from the source volume to all backups.
   * Under **Tags for backups**, you can manually add any extra plan tags in this field.

5. The plan summary displays your selections. For example, the plan might be "Every day at 5:30 UTC starting on February 21, 2022."

6. Click **Create** to save the new plan. The list of plans is updated in the policy details page. If you want to make any changes, click the pencil icon for that plan. If you want to delete the plan, click the delete icon.

### Estimate your expected usage and costs
{: #backup-cost-estimator-ui}

Use the cost estimator to see what your backups could cost based on the rate of expected change in your {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes.

1. After you [create your backup policy and plan](#backup-policy-create-ui), on the side panel of Backup summary, click **Add to estimate**.

2. On the Estimate side panel, enter your expected usage to the initial costs. The backup policy is free. You pay for the amount of backup storage that is used. Provide the following estimates:

   * Number of volumes you want to associate with the backup policy.

   * Average amount of data per volume (in GBs). For example, you might associate two volumes with a policy. The first volume has 4 GB of data and the second 20 GB. An average of the two would be 12 GB.

   * Number of backups per volume per month. Consider the backup frequency that you set in your backup plan. You can take a maximum of 750 backups per volume.

   * Percent of incremental change after the initial backup. For example, 15 percent increase in size for each subsequent backup.

3. When you're finished, click **Calculate cost**.

The cost estimate summary shows how the costs are calculated and breaks down the storage cost, providing a monthly estimate. Click **Save** to see the details on the cost estimator panel.

## Create backup policies and plans from the CLI
{: #backup-policy-create-cli}
{: cli}

Create a backup policy from the command-line interface (CLI).

### Before you begin
{: #before-creating-backup-cli}

1. Before you can use the CLI, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in. For more information, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).

2. After you install the VPC CLI plug-in, set the target to generation 2 by running the `ibmcloud is target --gen 2` command.

3. Make sure that you [created an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-cli#create-a-vpc-cli).

The general syntax for creating a backup policy and optional backup plan is as follows.

```zsh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-create --match-tags MATCH_TAGS [--name NAME] [[--plans PLANS_JSON | @PLANS_JSON_FILE] | --plan-cron-spec PLAN_CRON_SPEC [--plan-name PLAN_NAME] --plan-active [--plan-attach-tags PLAN_ATTACH_TAGS] [--plan-copy-tags true | false] [[--plan-delete-after PLAN_DELETE_AFTER] [--plan-delete-over-count PLAN_DELETE_OVER_COUNT]]] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID | --resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

* `--active` indicates whether the plan is active.

* `--cron-spec` indicates the `cron-spec` expression that defines the backup schedule.

* `--name` specifies the policy name.

* `--attach-tags` attaches user tags in the backup policy to each backup that is created by the plan. Updating this value doesn't change the user tags for backups that are already created by this plan.

* `--match-tags` attaches user tags in the backup policy to match tags to source volume tags.

* `--copy-tags` specifies whether source volume tags are copied to the backup snapshot (`true` or `false`).

* `--delete-after` sets the number of days to keep a backup before it is deleted.

* `--delete-over-count` sets the maximum number of recent backups to keep before the older backups are deleted.

Examples in the following sections use variations of this command to create a policy with no plan, a policy and plan together, or a separate backup plan for an existing policy, and multiple plans for an existing policy.

### Create a backup policy from the CLI
{: #backup-create-policy-noplan}

Run the `ibmcloud is backup-policy-create` command to create a backup policy without a backup plan. After the policy is created, you can [add backup plans](#backup-create-plan-cli) to it later on.

```zsh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-create --match-tags dev:test --name my-backup-policy-1

### Create a backup policy and plan from the CLI
{: #backup-create-policy-cron-cli}

Run the `backup-policy-create` command to create a backup policy and a backup plan in the same command. You can also [create plans separately](#backup-create-plan-cli) and add them to an existing policy.

This example uses the `--match_tags` parameter to match tags to volumes with the user tag `dev:test` and specifies a plan as a `cron-spec` expression.

The `--plan-attach-user-tags` parameter indicates that the same user tags are to be attached to the backup snapshot. Setting the `--plan-copy-user-tags` parameter to false indicates that the source volume's user tags are not copied to the backup. The `--plan-delete-after` parameter indicates the maximum number of days the backup are to be kept and the `--plan-delete-over-count` parameter indicates the maximum number of recent backups to keep.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-create --match-tags dev:test --name my-backup-policy-2 --plan-name my-plan-2 --plan-attach-tags dev:test --plan-copy-tags false --plan-delete-after 60 --plan-cron-spec '45 09 * * *' --plan-active  --plan-delete-over-count 2

### Create a backup plan from the CLI
{: #backup-create-plan-cli}

Run the `backup-policy-plan-create` command to create a backup plan and attach it to a policy. Identify the policy by ID or name.

Syntax:

```zsh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-create POLICY --cron-spec CRON_SPEC [--name NAME] [--active] [--attach-tags ATTACH_TAGS] [--copy-tags true | false] [[--delete-after DELETE_AFTER] [--delete-over-count DELETE_OVER_COUNT]] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

This example creates a backup plan for an existing policy, which is identified by name. It attaches backup policy tags to backup snapshots that are created by the policy, and copies source volume tags to the backup snapshot.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-create my-backup-policy-2  --attach-tags dev:test --copy-tags true --cron-spec '05 01 * * *' --delete-after 80 --name my-policy-plan-2

### Create a backup policy with multiple plans from the CLI
{: #backup-create-policy-multiplan-cli}

Run the `ibmcloud is backup-policy-create` command and define multiple plans in JSON. This example creates two plans, `my-policy-plan-1` and `my-policy-plan-99`.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-create --match-tags dev:test --name backup-policy-1  --plans '[{
      "active": true,
      "attach_user_tags": [
        "my-daily-backup-plan"
      ],
      "copy_user_tags": true,
      "cron_spec": "05 15 * * *",
      "deletion_trigger": {
        "delete_after": 20,
        "delete_over_count": 20
      },
      "name": "my-policy-plan-1"
    },{
      "active": true,
      "attach_user_tags": [
        "my-daily-backup-plan"
      ],
      "copy_user_tags": true,
      "cron_spec": "10 20 * * *",
      "deletion_trigger": {

      },
      "name": "my-policy-plan-99"
    }]'
```
{: pre}

The result shows that two plans were created.

## Create backup policies and plans with the API
{: #backup-policy-create-policy-plan-api}
{: api}

You can make calls to the VPC API to create backup policies and plans. A `POST /backup_policies` request creates a backup policy with tags that you provide to identify {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume resources that are to be backed up. The backup policy accepts a backup plan, where you define backup schedules and deletion rules.

### Create a backup policy and plan with the API
{: #backup-policy-create-api}

Make a `POST /backup_policies` request to create a new backup policy. The `match_user_tags` property identifies the backup tags on the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume resource and associates it with this plan. In this example, the backup plan is defined as a `cron_spec`.

```curl
