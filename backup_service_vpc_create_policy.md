# Creating a backup policy (Beta)
{: #backup-policy-create}

Create backup policies for your block storage volumes by using the UI, CLI, or API. Specify user tags in the policy ensure your data is backed up regularly. Create backups on schedule when tags applied to a volume match tags in a backup policy.
{: shortdesc}

This service is available only to accounts with special approval to preview this beta feature. Contact IBM Support if you're interested in getting access.
{: beta}

## Before you begin
{: #backup-prereqs}

Create user tags for new or existing data volumes that you associate with a backup policy. Add tags to existing volumes. Tags are important for viewing volume details, listing volumes filtered by tags. You can also update tags after creating a volume.

For information about adding tags, see [Apply tags to resources for backup policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-use-policies). For information about creating tags, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag). 

## Create a backup policy and plan using the UI
{: #backup-policy-create-ui}
{: ui}

### Backup policy provisioning page
{: #backup-provisioning-page-ui}

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/vpc-ext){: external}, go to **menu icon ![menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Storage > Backup policies**. The **Create** tab is selected by default.

2. Enter information for each section of the provisioning form in Table 1. 

3. When finished, **Save**. The page refreshes with a summary of the plan details. 

4. Optionally, [estimate the costs](#backup-cost-estimator-ui) for your backups.

5. Click **Create backup policy**. 

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Details** | Enter details to define the policy. A policy schedules backups of your resources. |
| Name  | Provide a unique name for your backup policy that easily identifies the policy. The standard naming conventions are used for policy and plan names. For information, see [these guidelines](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-block-storage&interface=ui#volume-name-conventions). |
| Resource group | Optionally, specify a resource group for your policy. It can't be changed after you enter it. |
| Tags | Add tags that you want to apply to this policy. This tag must match a block storage volume tag. |
| Access management tags | |
| Region | Select the region in which you want to create the backup policy. For Beta, you must specify one region where your volumes are located and your backups will exist. |
| **Tags for target resources** | Specify the user tags to apply to your target resources (block storage volumes) in your region. If multiple resources use the same tag, backups will be created for all resources. If a resource has multiple tags, it only needs to match one tag associated with the backup policy. After creating the backup policy, existing resources with any of the tags for target resources are automatically associated with this policy.Â |
| **Plan** | A backup plan specifies when to run the policy and the actions to perform. For Beta, you can have one plan per backup policy. Click **Create plan** to specify plan details in the side panel. When completed, the list populates with information about the plan associated with the backup policy and shows the frequency in which it executes. You can't modify a plan after you create it. See [Specify a backup plan](#backup-plan-ui) for information on the options for creating a plan. |

### Specify a backup plan using the UI
{: #backup-plan-ui}

#### Specify a backup plan by automated schedule
{: #backup-automated-plan-ui}

Using the UI, you can schedule backups in your plan on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis using predefined settings. These steps continue from [Creating a backup policy](#backup-policy-create-ui).

1. From the Plan side panel, enter a name for the plan (for example, _daily-dallas-vol1_). The plan name must be unique within the policy.

2. Under **Frequency**, select Daily, Weekly, or Monthly from the dropdown menu. 

   * For a Daily plan, enter the **starting time (UTC)** in hours and minutes, UTC. For example, 12 noon would be 12:00. Local time conversion is automatically provided, for example, 12 PM Central Daylight Time.
   * For a Weekly plan, select the days of the week you want backups to execute. For example, you could select Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Specify the starting time in the same manner as a Daily plan.
   * For a Monthly plan, select the day of the month you want backups to execute. For example, 1 would schedule a backup every first of the month. Specify the starting time in the same manner as a Daily plan.

    The **Backup destination** shows the block storage volume's region. The **Backup resource group** is the resource group associated with the volume.

3.  Specify a **Retention policy** that indicates how long to keep the backup before it's deleted. There is no default for the maximum number of days to retain a backup. Be aware that to keep costs down, set a retention period adequate to your needs. For example, setting 7 will retain a week's worth of backups.

4. Under **Tagging behavior (Optional)**, specify additional tags that apply to the backup when the plan executes.

   * Select the box to copy all tags from the targt resource (source block storage volume) to all backups created by this policy.
   
   * Or, under **Tags for backups**, specify any tags from the volume on this field.
   
5. Click **Save**. The plan summary displays your selections. For example, the plan might be "Every Monday at -5:53 UTC (12:30 AM CDT) starting on September 8, 2021." 

Note there is an **Edit** and **Delete** button, where you can modify the plan or remove it. For Beta, backup policies can have one plan, deleting it will mean you need to create a new plan. After you create the policy, you cannot modify the plan.

#### Specify a backup plan using a CRON expression to schedule backups
{: #backup-cron-plan-ui}

You can specify a backup plan to indicate frequency by way of a `cron-spec` expression.

1. From the Plan side panel, enter a name for the plan. For example, _daily-dallas-vol1_. 

2. Under **Frequency**, select **Specify using cron expression** from the drop down menu.

3. Under **Cron expression {UTC)**, enter the backup creation frequency in `cron-spec` format: minute, hour, day, month, and weekday. For example, to create a backup every day at 5:30 PM you'd enter `3017***`. **Executes on** defines the `cron-spec` expression, for example, "5:30 PM, every day".

   The **Backup destination** shows the block storage volume's region. The **Backup resource group** is the resource group associated with the volume.
4. Specify a **Retention policy** that indicates how long to keep the backup before it's deleted. There is no default for the maximum number of days to retain a backup. To keep costs down, set a retention period adequate to your needs.

5. Under **Tagging behavior (Optional)**, specify additional tags that apply to the backup when the plan executes.

   * Select the box to copy all tags from the source volume to all backups. 
   
   * Under **Tags for backups**, manually any additional plan tags in this field.
   
6. Click **Save**. The plan summary displays your selections. For example, the plan might be "Every day at 5:30 UTC starting on November 21, 2021."

Note there is an **Edit** and **Delete** button, where you can modify the plan or remove it. For Beta, backup policies can have one plan, deleting it will mean you need to create a new plan. After you create the policy, you cannot modify the plan.

### Estimate your expected usage and costs
{: #backup-cost-estimator-ui}

Use the cost estimator to see what your backups will cost based on the rate of expected change in your block storage volumes. 

1. After you [create your backup policy and plan](#backup-policy-create-ui), on the side panel Backup summary, click **Add to estimate**. 

2. On the Estimate side panel, enter your expected usage to initial costs. The backup policy is free. You pay for the amount of backup storage used. Provide the following estimates:

   * Number of volumes you will associate with the backup policy.

   * Average amount of data per volume (in GBs). For example, you might associate two volumes with a policy. The first volume has 4 GB of data and the second 20 GB. An average of the two would be 12 GB.

   * Number of backups per volume per month. Take into consideration the backup frequency you set in your backup plan. You can take a maximum of 100 backups per volume.

   * Percent of incremental change after the initial backup. For example, 15 percent increase in size for each subsequent backup.

3. When you're finished, click **Calculate cost**. 

The cost estimate summary shows how the costs are calculated and breaks down the storage cost, providing a monthly estimate. Click **Save** to see the details on the cost estimator panel.

## Create backup polcies and plans using the CLI
{: #backup-policy-create-cli}
{: cli}

Create a backup policy by using the command line interface (CLI).

### Before you begin
{: #before-creating-block-storage-cli}

1. Before you can use the CLI, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in. For more information, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).

2. After you install the VPC CLI plug-in, set the target to generation 2 by running the `ibmcloud is target --gen 2` command.
   
3. Make sure that you [created an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-cli#create-a-vpc-cli).

The syntax for creating a backup policy and plan is:

```text
ibmcloud is backup-policy-create [--match-user-tags MATCH_USER_TAGS] [--plan-cron-spec PLAN_CRON_SPEC [--plan-name PLAN_NAME] [--plan-attach-user-tags PLAN_ATTACH_USER_TAGS] [--plan-copy-user-tags true | false] [--plan-deletion-trigger PLAN_DELETION_TRIGGER]] [--name NAME] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID | --resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

### Create a backup policy and plan using the CLI
{: #backup-create-policy-cron-cli}

Run the `backup-policy-create` command to create a backup policy and plan. This example matches volumes with the user tag `dev:test` and specifies a plan as a cron-spec.

In this example, `plan-attach-user-tags` parameter indicates the same user tags will be attached to the backup. Setting the `plan-copy-user-tags` parameter to false indicates that the source volume's user tags are not copied to the backup. The deletion trigger indicates the number of days the backup will be kept.

```text
ibmcloud is backup-policy-create --match-user-tags dev:test --name my-backup-policy-2 --plan-name my-plan-2 --plan-attach-user-tags dev:test --plan-copy-user-tags false --plan-deletion-trigger 60 --plan-cron-spec '0 1,2,3 * * *'

## Create backup policies and plans with the API
{: #backup-policy-create-policy-plan-api}
{: api}

You can make calls to the VPC API to create backup policies and plans. A `POST /backup_policies` request creates a backup policy with tags you provide to identify block storage volume resources that will be backed up. The backup policy accepts a backup plan, where you define backup schedules and deletion rules.

### Create a backup policy and plan with the API
{: #backup-policy-create-api}

Make a `POST /backup_policies` request to create a new backup policy. The `match_user_tags` property identifies the backup tags on the block storage volume resource and associate it with this plan. In this example, the backup plan is defined as a `cron_spec`.
