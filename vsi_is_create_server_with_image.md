# Using an image to create a virtual server instance
{: #using-image-create-virtual-server}

You have different options to create a server with an image.

* When you [create a server](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers) by using the UI, you select the custom image in the `Image` tab of the `Operating system`.
* If you want to select from the list of {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} custom images, select `Custom image`.
* If you want to select from the list of {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} stock images, select `Stock image`.
* You can also select from the list of private catalog images by selecting `Catalog image`.

To use a private catalog custom image to create a server by using the API or CLI, see [Creating VPC resources with CLI and API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-vpc-resources-with-cli-and-api&interface=api) for examples.
