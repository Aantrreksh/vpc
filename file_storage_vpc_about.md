## Overview
{: #file-storage-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} provides file shares within the bounds of a VPC. You create a file share in a single availability zone. You then a create mount target to mount the file share. You can also set up replication between the source file share and a replica file share. If an outage is to occur at the primary site, you can fail over to the replica file share. For more information, see [About file share replication](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-replication).

You pay for only the capacity you need. File share capacity ranges from 10 GB up to 32,000 GB for all available profiles. You can [increase capacity](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-expand-capacity) of an existing file share and [adjust IOPS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-adjusting-share-iops) up or down to meet your performance needs. Billing is adjusted automatically.

File share data is encrypted by default with IBM-managed encryption for data-at-rest. For added security, you can also use your own root keys to protect your file shares. For more information, see [File share encryption](#FS-encryption).

You can apply user tags and access management tags to your file shares. Add tags when you create a share or updating an existing share with the UI, CLI, or API. For more information, see [Tags for file shares](#fs-about-fs-tags).

You can enable context-based restrictions (CBR) for all file share operations. These restrictions work with traditional IAM policies, which are based on identity, to provide an extra layer of protection. Unlike IAM policies, context-based restrictions don't assign access. Context-based restrictions check that an access request comes from an allowed context that you configure, such as creating a file share. For more information, see [Protecting Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Infrastructure Services with context-based restrictions (limited availability)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-cbr).

{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} is integrated with the Security and Compliance Center to help you manage security and compliance for your organization. For more information, see [Managing security and compliance](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-managing#fs-vpc-manage-security).

### File storage IOPS profiles
{: #fs-profiles-intro}

You have two options for creating file shares, by using an IOPS tier profile or by using a custom IOPS profile.

IOPS tiers provide a guaranteed level of performance for your workloads. You can select from three tiers:

* 3 IOPS/GB,
* 5 IOPS/GB,
* 10 IOPS/GB.

With a Custom IOPS profile you can select the performance you want, by selecting custom allocated I/O operations per second (IOPS).

For more information about these options, see [{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles#fs-tiers).

### Zonal file shares
{: #fs-zonal-file-shares}

You can create {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} shares at the zonal level. In other words, that file shares are accessible only within the zone in which you created it, for example, `us-south-1`. File shares are identified by name and associated with a resource group in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} customer account.

You create a file share by using the UI, CLI, or API. You access file shares from virtual server instances or Kubernetes clusters by way of an NFS mount. To create an NFS mount path, you need to create mount targets.

You can [increase the file share size](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-expand-capacity) from its original capacity in GB increments up to 32,000 GB capacity, depending on your file share profile. You can also [increase or decrease file share IOPS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-adjusting-share-iops) to meet your performance needs. Adjust IOPS by specifying a different IOPS tier profile or different IOPS value withing a custom IOPS band. The operation to increase capacity or adjust IOPS causes no outage or lack of access to the storage.

### Mount targets for file shares
{: #fs-share-mount-targets}

A mount target for a file share is a network endpoint or path. When you create a mount target, an NFS mount path is created for the file share. You use the mount path to attach the file share to virtual server instances or Kubernetes clusters in the same VPC and zone.

To mount a file share to an instance with the API, you create a mount target by providing a VPC or subnet information. If you want to connect a file share to instances that are running in multiple VPCs in the same zone, you can create multiple mount targets for different VPCs. After the mount target (or targets) is created, you can SSH into the virtual server instance and attach the file share.

### NFS version
{: #fs-nfs-version}

{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} requires NFS versions v4.1 or higher.

## Limitations in this release
{: #fs-limitations}

The following limitations apply to this release of {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}}.

* File share size cannot be increased after it is created.
* File share profile cannot be changed after the file share is created.
* Granular Host Authorization for VSI level access control in not supported.
* Windows operating systems are not supported.
* Minimum capacity is 10 GB per file share.
* Maximum capacity is 32,000 GB per file share.
* No data retention policy exists for deleted file shares. You cannot undelete a file share after you delete it.

## File share encryption
{: #FS-encryption}

By default, file share data is encrypted at rest with IBM-managed encryption.

You can bring your own customer root key (CRK) to the cloud for customer-managed encryption or you can have a key management service (KMS) generate a key for you. You can [manage your root keys](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-managing) by rotating, disabling, or deleting the keys.

You can select the root key when you [create a new encrypted file share](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-encryption). For more information, see [Customer-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about#vpc-customer-managed-encryption).

After you specified an encryption type for a file share, you can't change it.

## File share replication and failover
{: #fs-repl-failover-overview}

You can create replicas of your file shares by setting up a replication relationship between primary file shares in one zone to replica file shares in another zone. Using replication is a good way to recover from incidents at the primary site when data becomes inaccessible or applications fail. [Fail over](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-failover) to the replica share makes it the new, writeable primary share. For more information, see [About file share replication](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-replication).

## Supplemental IDs and Groups for file shares
{: #FS-supplemental-ids}

When a process runs on Unix or Linux, the operating system identifies a user with a user ID (UID) and group with a group ID (GID). These IDs determine which system resources a user or group can access. For example, if the target file storage user ID is 12345 and its group ID is 6789, then the mount on the host node and in a container must have those same IDs. The containerâ€™s main process must match one or both of those IDs to access the file share.

with the API, you can set these attributes for controlling access to your file shares when you create a file share. The API provides an `initial owner` property where you can set the `UID` and `GID` values. Wherever you mount the file share, the root folder where you mount it uses that UID or GID owner. For more information, see [Add supplemental IDs when you create a file share](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-create&interface=api#fs-add-supplemental-id-api).

## Tags for file shares
{: #fs-about-fs-tags}

{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} is enabled for Global Searching and Tagging (GhoST). You can create and apply [user tags](#fs-about-user-tags) and [access management tags](#fs-about-mgt-tags) to file shares to better control and organize your file storage resources across the VPC. User tags can be added from the file service UI, CLI, or API. To apply access management tags to file shares, you must use the GhoST API.

### User tags for file shares
{: #fs-about-user-tags}

You can create new user tags or add existing tags when you provision a new file share or update an existing file share. You can create, view, and manage tags from the UI, CLI, or API, and remove then at any time.

User tags are uniquely identified by a Cloud Resource Name (CRN) identifier. When you create a user tag, you provide a unique name within your billing account. You can define user tags in label or key-value format. Behind the scenes, the file service sends and receives tags directly to the GhoST service. GhoST stores its key attributes and the array of tags. GhoST also stores user resource information, so you can view, tag, and search for resources you own.

For more information, see [Add user tags to file shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-managing&interface=ui#fs-add-user-tags) and [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag&interface=ui).

### Access management tags for file shares
{: #fs-about-mgt-tags}

Access management tags help organize access control by creating flexible resource groupings, enabling your file storage resources to grow without requiring updates to IAM policies.

You can create access management tags and then apply them to new or existing file shares and replica file shares. Use the IAM UI or the Global Search and Tagging API to create the access management tag. Then, from the VPC UI or API, add the tags to a file share. After the tags are added, you can manage access to them using the IAM policies. For more information, see [Add access management tags to a file share](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-managing&interface=ui#fs-add-access-mgt-tags).
