# Why can't my endpoint gateway reach the target {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service?
{: #troubleshoot-cannot-reach-target}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

Even though the endpoint gateway is healthy, it cannot reach the target {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} service.
{: shortdesc}

Verify that the cloud service instance is available to others by trying to access the public endpoint cloud service instance directly. If you cannot access the serviceâ€™s public endpoint, open an IBM Support case.

To check the `Health` and `Lifecycle` states of your VPE, you can use the UI, or enter the following command:

```sh
ibmcloud is endpoint-gateway <endpoint_gateway_id>
```
{: pre}

To list all endpoint gateways, run this command:
```sh
ibmcloud is egs
```
