# Troubleshooting for quota dashboard
{: #quota-troubleshooting}

If the quota dashboard does not display metrics as expected, the following methods are used for troubleshooting.

## Adjust the time range of the dashboardâ€™s view
{: #time-range}

When an event that generates a metric is not visible on the dashboard, first check the time interval set for the dashboard. If the interval is too large, or the event is out of the interval's scope, events are not visible.

To adjust the time interval for the dashboard

1. Select the time bar on the dashboard that displays a timeframe, such as *9:20 AM - 10:20 AM*.
2. Adjust the value in the *From* textbox to change the date and time the interval begins.
3. Adjust the value in the *To* text boxes to change the date and time the interval ends.
4. Save the values. The dashboard refreshes.

## Generating a metric
