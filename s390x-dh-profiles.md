# s390x dedicated host profiles
{: #s390x-dh-profiles}

A dedicated host profile is a combination of attributes, such as the number of vCPUs, amount of RAM, and optionally instance storage that define the amount of compute capacity that is provided in a host that is provisioned exclusively for your use.
{: shortdesc}

For information about dedicated host profiles for x86 processor architecture, see [x86-64 dedicated host profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-dh-profiles).

For Wazi as a Service, dedicated hosts are currently available in the Spain (Madrid) and US South (Dallas) region only.
{: note}

The following profile families are available:

| Families | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Memory](#s390x-dh-memory) | Best for memory intensive processes, such as memory caching, intensive database applications, or in-memory analytics workloads. Memory profiles offer vCPU to memory ratios with 1 vCPU to 8 GiB of RAM. Memory profiles are offered with and without instance storage. |

{: #dh-memory-s390x}

For more information about the profiles, see [Understanding profiles](#s390x-dh-profiles-naming-rule).

## Memory
{: #s390x-dh-memory}

The Memory profile is best for memory intensive workloads, such as large caching workloads, intensive database applications, or in-memory analytics workloads. The Memory with instance storage profile is best for memory intensive workloads, such as large caching workloads, intensive database applications, or in-memory analytics workloads.

The following Memory profile is available for dedicated hosts.

| Dedicated host profile | vCPU | GiB RAM | Instance storage | 
|---------|---------|---------| ---------|
| mz2-host-40x320 | 40 | 320 | - |
{: caption="Table 2. s390x memory profile options for dedicated hosts" caption-side="bottom"}

Dedicated hosts have a network performance cap of 80 Gbps. Instances that are created on the host share bandwidth across the instances.

## Viewing profile configurations
{: #dh-popular-profiles}

You can view available profile configurations by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console or the CLI. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, you can select from popular profile configurations that support most common use cases.

### Understanding profiles
{: #s390x-dh-profiles-naming-rule}

The following example describes the individual parts that make up a dedicated host profile name.

| Family | Architecture | Generation | Specialty | Offering | vCPU | RAM |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------| -------- | ---- | --- |
| m      | z            | 2         | -        | host-    | 40x | 320  |
{: caption="Table 3. Individual parts that comprise the dedicated host profile" caption-side="bottom"}

The first character represents the profile family. Different profile families have different ratios of CPU to memory, which is designed for different workloads.
- "b": balanced family, 1:4 ratio
- "c": compute family (higher on the CPUs), 1:2 ratio
- "m": memory family (higher on the memory), 1:16 ratio
- "v": very high memory family (higher memory with instance storage), 1:14 ratio 
- "u": ultra high memory family (higher memory with instance storage), 1:28 ratio

The second character represents the CPU architecture.
- "x": x86_64
- "z": System Z

The third character represents the generation of VPC the profile is for.
- The generation of the underlying hardware

The fourth character in the profile prefix, if it exists, represents a profile specialty.
- "d": indicates that this profile creates a dedicated host with the capability to host virtual server instances that include instance storage.
- "a": AMD manufactured 

The field after the first hyphen "-" represents the offering, in this example, the dedicated host offering.

The field after the second hyphen "-" represents the number of vCPU and the size of RAM (GB). "40x320" means that this profile has 40 vCPU and a RAM of 320 GB.

For the “mz2-host-40x320” profile, you can know from the name that it is a Memory Instance Storage host profile with a 1:16 CPU to memory ratio (40 vCPU and 320 GB RAM). The CPU architecture is System Z and this profile is for second-generation hardware.

### Using the IBM Cloud console
{: #s390x-dh-profiles-using-console}
{: ui}

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Compute > Dedicated hosts**.
2. From the Dedicated host page, click **Create**.
3. You can select from available profile configurations.

### Using the CLI
{: #dh-profiles-using-cli}
{: cli}

To view the list of available profiles by using the CLI, run the following command:
```sh
ibmcloud is dedicated-host-profiles
```
{: codeblock}


## Next steps
{: #s390x-dh-nextsteps}

After you choose a profile, it's time to create a dedicated host.
