# Troubleshooting virtual server instances for VPC
{: #troubleshooting-your-virtual-servers-for-vpc}

If you experience difficulties with your {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}} instances, review the following possible causes.

## Permissions not set up in IBM Cloud

Before you can create {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}}, you need the correct permissions to be set up in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. If your permissions are not correct, you can create a server and it shows `Pending` status, which quickly turns into `Failed` status. Make sure that the master of the account assigns you the correct [permissions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources#managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources).

## Servers are all in Unknown status

Most likely you do not have adequate permissions to view the server status. Make sure that you have the correct [permissions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources#managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources).

The Unknown status also might be caused by an expired IMS token. Run `bx sl init` again and rebuild the `ims_subject` with the new token. Make sure that you are passing in the `X-Subject-Token:$ims_subject` parameter in the request header.

## Error: 409 Conflict when you create an instance action

You can't create certain instance actions if the status of your instance is in conflict with another action. For example, if your instance status is `stopped`, and you try to create a `reboot` action, the system returns a 409 error.

| Status      | Action     | Conflict |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Running     | start      | yes      |
| Stopped     | not start  | yes      |
| Not running | pause      | yes      |
| Not running | reboot     | yes      |
| Not paused  | resume     | yes      |
| Paused      | not resume | yes      |

## Instance not responding to `instance-reboot` request

If your instance is not responding to an `instance-reboot` request, you can try an `instance-reset` request. The `instance-reboot` request sends an OS-reboot request to the instance, while an `instance-reset` request performs a hard reset of the VSI instance. You can think of the difference as typing "ctrl-alt-delete" on your computer's keyboard versus pressing the reset or power button. Remember that the `instance-reset` request takes longer to complete than the `instance-reboot` request.
