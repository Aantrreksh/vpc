# About Backup for VPC
{: #backup-service-about}

Use {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Backup for VPC to automatically create backups and restore {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes from backup snapshots. By using this service, you can prevent data loss, manage risk, and improve data compliance. You can ensure that your data is backed up regularly, and you can retain the backups while you need them. You can create and manage backup policies and plans for your {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes by using the UI, the CLI, the API, or Terraform.
{: shortdesc}

Backups and snapshots services are different than a disaster recovery (DR) solution, where your data is continually backed up with automatic failover. Restoring a volume from a backup or a snapshot is a manual operation that takes time. If you require a higher level of service for disaster recovery, see IBM's [Cloud disaster recovery solutions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/disaster-recovery).
{: note}

## Backup service concepts
{: #backup-service-concepts}

You can create up to 10 backup policies for your {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes in one region with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Backup for VPC service. A backup policy contains one or more backup plans, which define a schedule for automated backups. You can create up to four plans per policy, and edit and delete them as needed. If you're undecided on the backup schedule or you don't know all the tags yet, you can create a backup policy without a plan and add one later.

Before you create backups, review the [planning your backups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-planning) topic. For more information, see [best practices for creating backups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-best-practices).
{: tip}

In a backup plan, you schedule the frequency of your backups. In the UI, you can choose daily, weekly, or monthly. You can also use a `cron` expression to specify the frequency in the [UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-backup-policy-and-plan&interface=ui), from the [CLI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-backup-policy-and-plan&interface=cli), with the [API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-backup-policy-and-plan&interface=api) or [Terraform](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-backup-policy-and-plan&interface=terraform).

You must set a [retention period](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-policy-create&interface=ui#backup-automated-plan-ui) for your backups. It can be based on the number of days that you want to keep the backups. Or it can be based on the total number of backups that you want to retain before the oldest ones are deleted. Planning for the retention and deletion of your backups can keep the costs down.

Backups require that the volume that you're backing up is attached to a running virtual server instance. Put another way, you can't back up an unattached volume.

A volume is backed up when a [user-provided tag](#backup-service-about-tags) that is associated with a {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume match the tags for target resources in a backup policy. The volume must have at least one of the backup policyâ€™s tags for the target resources. When the scheduled backup is triggered by a backup plan, all volumes with matching tags are backed up. You can [view the status of the backup jobs](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-view-policy-jobs) in the UI, from the CLI, or the API.

If a volume has multiple tags, only one tag needs to match for a backup to trigger. You can add user tags to boot and data volumes at any time, when you [create a virtual server instance](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-block-storage&interface=ui#create-from-vsi) or in an instance template.

When the backup is triggered at the scheduled interval, a backup copy is created of your volume contents. Behind the scenes, the [Snapshot for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about) service is used to create a point-in-time copy of your data. When the first backup snapshot is taken, the entire contents of the volume are copied and retained in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}. Subsequent backups of the same volume capture the changes that occurred since the previous backup. You can take up to 750 backups of a volume.

You can [restore](#backup-service-restore-concepts) data from a backup snapshot to a new, fully provisioned volume. If the backup is of a boot volume, you can use it to provision a new instance. However, when you provision an instance by restoring a boot volume from a bootable backup snapshot, you can expect degraded performance in the beginning. During the restoration process, the data is copied from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} to {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}}, and thus the provisioned IOPS cannot be fully realized until that process finishes.

You can copy a backup snapshot from one region to another region, and later use that snapshot to restore a volume in the new region. The [cross-regional copy](#backup-service-crc) can be used in disaster recovery scenarios when you need to turn on your virtual server instance and data volumes in a different region. The remote copy can be created automatically as part of a backup plan, or manually later.

With the fast restore feature, you can cache snapshots in a specified zone of your choosing. This way, volumes can be restored from snapshots nearly immediately and the new volumes operate with full IOPS instantly. The fast restore feature can achieve a [recovery time objective](#x3167918){: term} (RTO) quicker than restoring from a regular backup snapshot. When you opt for fast restore, your existing regional plan is adjusted, including billing. For more information about the cost of fast restore, see [Pricing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vpc/pricing){: external}.

### Comparison of backups and snapshots
{: #baas-comparison}

Backups are in effect, backup snapshots. In the console, backups appear in the list of {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} snapshots. Backups are identified by how they were created, in this case, by backup policy. These terms are used interchangeably in the Documentation, depending on the context.

The snapshots service is used to create backups, similarities and differences exist between backups and snapshots. Table 1 compares backups to snapshots.

### Benefits of creating backups
{: #backup-service-benefits}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Backup for VPC offers you the following benefits.

* Prevent data loss - Protect your critical data by scheduling regular backups. Establish a data restoration plan to quickly restore your compromised volumes. Reduce technical and financial impacts from unplanned outages.

* Protect against small-scale failures - Restore from a bootable snapshot if a host failure or malicious attack occurs.

* Improve compliance - You can prevent issues that are related to compliance and regulatory requirements by ensuring that backups are in place and data can be restored easily.

* Save costs - A backup policy retention plan means that backups are regularly deleted, reducing costs by not storing more data than needed.

* Ease of management - IBM's backup service is easier to manage than a third-party backup service because it is fully integrated with your VPC resources.

### Backup policies and backup plans
{: #backup-service-policies}

Backup policies consist of plans that define schedules for automatic backup creation and data retention. You can schedule backups on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

You can specify the retention period or the total number of backups before the oldest are deleted. The default retention period is 30 days. Alternatively, you can set the total number of backups to retain up to 750 per volume. When that number is exceeded, the oldest backups are deleted.

The interval for creating a backup and its retention period can be the same or they can be different.

Backups that are created by the backup plan inherit the parent volume resource group details. You can create up to four plans per backup policy and modify the backup schedule and retention policy anytime. Your four plans can have different frequencies. For example, one can be daily. Another one can be weekly, and so on. All plans apply to the volumes with tags that match the backup policy.

You can [view backup job status](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-view-policy-jobs) while backups are being created, modified, or deleted.

### Tags for target resources
{: #backup-service-about-tags}

Backup policies contain user tags for target resources that associate the policy with {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes with the same user tag. To create backups, at least one user tag that is applied to a volume must match the tag for target resources in the backup policy. User tags are added by an authorized user in the account. Any user with the correct access role can list and can delete user tags in the account on the condition that the tags are not attached to any resource.

In addition to user tags, tags can be access management tags and service tags. Only user tags are applied to backup policies. [Access management tags](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-block-storage&interface=ui#storage-add-access-mgt-tags) are used to manage access to resources; only the account administrator can create access management tags. Service tags are a privileged construct that only authorized services can manage. Users are not authorized to attach and detach service tags on a resource, even if they have access to manage tags on the resource. Service tags are helpful to distinguish which snapshots were created manually or automatically by a backup policy.
{: note}

If a volume has multiple tags, only one tag needs to match a backup policy tag. Based on the schedule in the backup plan, a matching tag triggers a backup. If multiple volume tags match backup policy tags, only one backup is created at the scheduled interval. If you have multiple volumes with the same tag, backups are created for all the volumes.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} does not limit the number of tags that you can specify for your resources. However, keeping the number low can make it easier to track the number of backups that you're creating. For more information, see [Applying backup policies to resources with tags](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-use-policies).

### Restoring a volume from a backup
{: #backup-service-restore-concepts}

You can create a separate volume from a backup snapshot. This process is called restoring a volume. It works the same way as restoring data from manually created snapshots. Restoring a volume from a backup snapshot creates a fully provisioned {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} boot or data volume.

A volume can be restored when you create an instance, modify an instance, or when you create a stand-alone volume (no instance provisioning is required). Volume data restoration begins immediately as the volume is hydrated, but [performance is degraded](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore&interface=ui#baas-performance-considerations) until the volume is fully restored. Restoring from a bootable snapshot is slower than using a regular boot volume.

While the creation of the backup requires the volumes to be attached to a running virtual server instance, you can also restore a data volume from a snapshot of an unattached volume. Backups, like snapshots, have a lifecycle that is independent from the source {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume.

The restored volume has the same capacity and IOPS tier profile as the original volume. For more information, see [Restoring a volume from a backup snapshot](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore).

### Restoring a volume by using fast restore
{: #backup-service-fastrestore}

When you restore a volume by using fast restore, a fully hydrated volume is created.

You can create a [backup policy plan](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-backup-policy-and-plan&interface=ui#backup-plan-ui) with fast restore zones, and add or remove zones later as needed. The fast restore feature caches one or more copies of a backup snapshot to the zones that you selected. Later, you can use these backup clones to create volumes in any zone within the same region.

For more information, see [Restoring a volume from a backup snapshot](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore).

### Cross-regional backup copies
{: #backup-service-crc}

You can copy a backup snapshot from one region to another region, and later use that snapshot to restore a volume in the new region. You can use and manage the cross-regional snapshot in the target region independently from the parent volume or the original snapshot.

If the source snapshot is not encrypted with a customer key, the encryption of the copy remains provider-managed. If the source snapshot is protected by a customer-managed key, you must specify the customer-managed key that you want to use to encrypt the new copy.

Only one copy of the backup snapshot can exist in each region. You can't create a copy of the backup snapshot in the source (local) region.
{: restriction}

Creating a cross-regional copy affects billing. You're charged for the data transfer and the storage consumption in the target region separately.

## User roles for backup policies
{: #backup-service-user-roles}

Depending on your assigned role as a backup user, you can create and administer backup policies. Table 1 describes these capabilities.

{: caption="Table 3. Snapshot user roles for backup policies" caption-side="bottom"}

## Service-to-service authorizations
{: #baas-s2s-auth}

Specific IAM user roles are required to grant service-to-service authorization that enables the backup service to detect volume tags to create a backup. For more information, see [Establishing service to service authorizations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-s2s-auth).

## Limitations in this release
{: #backup-service-limitations}

This release has the following limitations.

* You can create up to 10 backup policies per account.
* You can take a total of 750 backups per volume based on your backup policy, in your account and region. If you exceed this limit, no further backups are taken.
* The first backup and the entire volume backup cannot exceed 10 TB.
* You can't take a backup of a detached volume.
* You can't create a copy of a backup snapshot in the source (local) region. 
* You can create a copy of a backup in another region. However, only one copy of the backup snapshot can exist in each region.

## Next steps
{: #backup-next-steps}

Review [best practices](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-best-practices) for creating a backup policy and the [planning checklist](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-planning). Afterward, you can [create backup policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-backup-policy-and-plan).
