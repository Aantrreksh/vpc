# Backup for VPC
{: #backup-service-about}

Use {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Backup for VPC to automatically back up, manage, and restore block storage volumes from backups. By using this service, you prevent data loss, manage risk, and improve data compliance. The backup service let's you create and manage backup policies for your block storage volumes. Apply these policies to your volumes to assure your data is backed up regularly. Retain the backups as long as you need.
{: shortdesc}

## Backup service concepts
{: #backup-service-concepts}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Backup for VPC service lets you create backup policies for your block storage volumes. A backup policy contains a backup plan, which defines a schedule for automated backups. You can create up to four plans per policy, and edit and delete them as needed. You can view and manage backup jobs to see these actions. If you're undecided on how often to schedule backups or you don't know all the tags yet for your target resources, you can optionally create a backup policy without a plan and add one later.

When the backup is triggered at the scheduled interval, a backup is created of your volume contents. A backup is actually a snapshot. Behind the scenes, the [Snapshots for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about) service is used to create a point-in-time copy of your data. The entire contents of the volume are copied (snapshotted) and retained. Subsequent backups of the same volume capture the changes since the previous backup. You can take up to 100 backups of a volume. 

Backups appear in the list of block storage snapshots. They are identified by how they were created, in this case, by backup policy. Backups are in effect, backup snapshots. These terms are used interchangeably in the documentation, depending on the context.
{: note}

In a backup plan, you schedule the [frequency](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-policy-create&interface=ui#backup-automated-plan-ui) of your backups. In the UI, you can choose daily, weekly, or monthly. You can also add a schedule with a [`cron` expression](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-policy-create&interface=ui#backup-cron-plan-ui).

You also set a [retention period](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-policy-create&interface=ui#backup-automated-plan-ui) for your backups. This can be based on the number of days you want to keep the backups or the total number of backups to retain before they are deleted. Planning for your retention and deletion of backups will keep your costs down.

Backup's require that the volume you're backing up is attached to a running virtual server instance. Put another way, you can't backup an unattached volume.

A volume is backed up when [user-provided tags](#backup-service-about-tags) associated with a block storage volume match tags for target resources in a backup policy. The volume must have at least one of the backup policyâ€™s tags for the target resources. When the scheduled backup is triggered by a backup plan, all volumes with matching tags in the policy are backed up. If a volume has multiple tags, only one tag has to match for a backup to trigger. 

Use the UI, CLI, or API to create backup policies and plans for your block storage volumes. Before creating backups, see this information on [planning your backups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-planning). For best practices and other considerations when creating backups, see [Best practices for creating backups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-best-practices).

You can [restore](backup-service-restore-concepts) a new, fully provisioned volume from a backup snapshot. If the backup is of a boot volume, you can use it to provision a new instance. Note that there are performance considerations when using a restoring a boot volume from "bootable" backup snapshot when provisioning a new instance. For more information, see [Performance considerations when using a bootable backup snapshot](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore&interface=ui#baas-boot-perf). 

### Comparison of backups and snapshots
{: #baas-comparison}

While the snapshots service is used in the background to create backups, there are similarities and differences between backups and snapshots. Table 1 compares backups to snapshots.

Backups and snapshots services are different than a disaster recovery (DR) solution, where your data is continually backed up with automatic failover. Restoring a volume from a backup or snapshot is a manual operation that takes time.

### Benefits of creating backups
{: #backup-service-benefits}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Backup for VPC offers you the following benefits:

* Prevent data loss - Protect your critical data by scheduling regular backups. Establish a data restoration plan to quickly restore your compromised volumes. Reduce technical and financial impacts from unplanned outages. 

* Protect against small-scale failures - Restore from a bootable snapshot in case of host failue or malicious attack.

* Improve compliance - By ensuring backups are in place and data can be easily restored, you prevent compliance and regulatory issues.

* Save costs - A backup policy retention plan means that backups are regularly deleted, reducing costs from too much overhead.

* Easier management - Using IBM's backup service is far easier to manage than a third-party backup service because it's fully integrated with your VPC resources.

### Backup policies and backup plans
{: #backup-service-policies}

Backup policies consist of plans that define schedules for automatic backup creation and data retention. You can schedule backups on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

You specify the retention period or total number of backups before the oldest are deleted. The default retention period is 30 days. Alternatively, you can set the total number of backups to retain up to 100 per volume backed up, after which the oldest backups are deleted.

The interval for creating a backup and its retention period can be the same or different. 

Backups created by the backup plan inherit the parent volume resource group details. You create up to four plans per backup policy and modify the backup schedule and retention policy. You can create up to four backup plans, for example, one that's daily, one that's weekly, and so on. All plans apply to the volumes with tags that match the backup policy.

You can view backup job status while backups are being created, modified, or deleted.

The backups created by the policy can be restored to create a new volume.

### Tags for target resources
{: #backup-service-about-tags}

Backup policies specify user tags for target resources that associate the policy with block storage volumes, for the purpose of creating a backup. The user tag applied to a volume must match the tag for target resources in the backup policy.

Tags can be user tags or access management tags. User tags are added by an authorized user in the account. Any user with the correct access role in an account can list and can delete both service and user tags in the account as long as they are not attached to any resource. Access management tags are used to manage access to resources; only the account administrator can create access management tags. 

Service tags are a privileged construct that only authorized services can manage. Users are not authorized to attach and detach service tags on a resource, even if they have access to manage tags on the resource. Service tags are helpful to distinguish which snapshots were created manually or automatically by a backup policy.
{: note}

If a volume has multiple tags, only one tag needs to match a backup policy tag. Based on the schedule in the backup plan, a matching tag triggers a backup. If multiple volume tags match backup policy tags, only one backup is created at the scheduled interval. If you have multiple volumes with the same tag, backups are created for all the volumes.

There is no limit to the number of tags you can specify for your resources. However, using a reasonable number will make it easy to keep track of the number of backups you're creating. For information about adding tags, see [Applying backup policies to resources using tags](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-use-policies).

### Restoring a volume from a backup
{: #backup-service-restore-concepts}

You can create a new volume from a backup snapshot created by a backup policy. This process is called restoring a volume. It works the same way as manually created snapshots. Restoring a volume from a backup snapshot creates a fully provisioned block storage boot or data volume. 

Restoring is as easy as going to the list of block storage snapshots, picking a snapshot, and clicking **Create volume** from the overflow menu. This process lets you create a new volume and attach it to an existing instance or new instance.
You can also select a backup snapshot of a boot volume when provisioning a new instance. Because the bootable backup snapshot is not fully hydrated, performance will be slower than using a regular boot volume. For more information, see [Performance considerations when using a bootable backup snapshot](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore&interface=ui#baas-boot-perf). For more information about restoring a volume, see [Restoring a volume from a backup snapshot](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore). The restored volume has the same capacity and IOPS tier profile as the original volume. Restoring a boot volume creates a volume you can use to start up an instance. Restoring a data volume provides a secondary volume attached to the instance.

## User roles for backup policies
{: #backup-service-user-roles}

Depending on your assigned role as a backup user you can create and administer backup policies. Table 1 describes these capabilities.

| Backup user role | What you can do: |
|------|------------------|
| **Viewer, Operator** | List all backup policies  |
| | View details of a backup policy |
| | View a backup plan | 
| **Editor, Administrator** | Organize and manage snapshots using tags |
| | Associate backup policies to volumes using user tags |
| | Create, update, and delete backup policies and plans |
| | Specify CRON format to schedule snapshot creation |
{: caption="Table 1. User roles for backup policies" caption-side="bottom"}

Volume users with an editor role can do the following:

* Create data volumes with user tags
* View volume details with user tags
* List volumes filtered by tag
* Update user tags post volume creation

Snapshots users with an editor role can do the following:

* Create snapshots with user tags
* View snapshot details with tags
* List snapshots filtered by tag
* Update user tags post snapshot creation

## Service-to-service authorizations
{: #baas-s2s-auth}

Specific IAM user roles are required to grant service-to-service authorizations that enables the backup service to detect volume tags to create a backup. For more information, see 
[Establishing service to service authorizations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-s2s-auth).

## Limitations in this release
{: #backup-service-limitations}

Limitations for this release include the following:

* Backups are restricted to a single region. You cannot share backups or create backup policies across regions.
* You can create up to 10 backup polices per account.
* You can take a total of 100 backups per volume based on your backup policy, in your account and region. Backups will fail if you exceed this limit.
* The first backup and/or the entire volume backup cannot exceed 10 TB.
* You can't take a backups of a detached volume.
