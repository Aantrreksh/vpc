# About Veeam
{: #about-veeam}

You can use Veeam software to back up your storage data on a virtual server instance for {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} to protect:
  * A complete system
  * Individual volumes
  * Folders and files

The Veeam Agent for Linux and the Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows provides a stand-alone ability to do backups and restores for storage that is attached to individual virtual server instances. Additionally, with the Veeam Backup and Replication tool for Microsoft Windows, you can manage backup for multiple Linux and Microsoft Windows virtual server instances through a single interface.
