          "description": "Protocol state filtering works well if the packet forwarding path and the return path are the same, and if the packet forwarding path is never changed. However, the VPC routing table supports two-way ECMP routes. When a two-way ECMP route is configured, the forward path might differ from the return path and protocol state filtering can cause legitimate packets to drop. You can now disable protocol state filtering when intermittent routing issues occur."

          "title": "Security group support for secondary IP addresses (GA)",
          "description": "You can now attach both primary and secondary IP addresses to a security group to refine the binding of security groups rules to a particular port IP instead of all IPs belonging to the port. Also, security group rules now support both source and destination on ingress and egress rules. This allows customers with multiple, secondary private IP addresses associated with a single vNIC to have the ability to apply security group rules to source and destination IP addresses, thus enabling finer granularity in security rules. This enhancement provides the capability to secure the primary IP different from the secondary IPs, and also applies to VIP prefixes (custom routes) used with a vNIC with IP spoofing disabled."
