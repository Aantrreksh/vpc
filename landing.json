You can create this custom image by specifying one of the new operating systems with properties that indicate it is generic. When you provision a server by using a generic operating system custom image, most operating system-specific provisioning steps aren't performed, such as console setup and automatic registration. You must provide the appropriate user data if you want your generic operating system custom image to perform these steps."
