The number of interfaces that a virtual server supports depends on the vCPU count that is in the instance profile. Profiles that include 17 - 48 vCPUs now support up to 10 network interfaces. Profiles that include 49 or more vCPUs now support up to 15 network interfaces. For existing virtual servers with 17 or more vCPUs to take advantage of the new network interface limits, a running virtual server instance must be stopped and restarted."

          "description": "You can now share or publish custom images to other accounts within your enterprise by using a private catalog. A private catalog provides a way for you to manage access to products for multiple accounts. You can use any existing x86 virtual server custom image with a private catalog, with the exception of an encrypted image. Custom images can't be deleted while being managed from a catalog and can only be managed from one catalog product offering version at a time. Deleting the catalog does not free its managed resources for a 7-day reclamation period. If you plan to share images with other accounts, users in those accounts should be aware of considerations related to cross-account references to those images. For more information, see Using cross-account image references in a private catalog. Custom images can also be published to the IBM Cloud catalog and to other (non-enterprise) accounts. This process requires onboarding to the IBM Cloud Partner Center. "
