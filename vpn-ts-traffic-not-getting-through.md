For application traffic to flow through a connection, the right configurations must be in place, including ACLs configured on both sides.
{: shortdesc}

{: tsSymptoms}
Your connection is active, but traffic is not getting through.

{: tsCauses}
There might be an interoperability issue.

{: tsResolve}
Follow these steps to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure NAT-Traversal is enabled on the peer, if it is a configurable option.
1. Make sure ACLs are configured properly on both sides to allow application traffic.
1. If using a policy-based mode VPN with a static, route-based VPN peer and multiple CIDR/subnets on either side, make sure to create multiple connections with one CIDR/subnet pair per connection.
1. If using a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) as the peer of VPN for VPC with multiple CIDRs/subnets configured on the Cisco side, try moving different subnets to separate connections.
1. If using a route-based VPN on either side, make sure that routes on each side are configured properly so that traffic is routed to the VPN gateway appropriately.Â
