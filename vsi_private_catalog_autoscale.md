# Using a custom image in a private catalog with an instance group
{: #private-catalog-image-instance-group}

To use a custom image in a private catalog with an instance group, a service-to-service policy to `globalcatalog-collection.instance.retrieve` must be created first. This policy grants access to your custom image in a private catalog to be used when you provision instances for your instance groups. For more information about custom images that are shared to a private catalog, see [Getting started with custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images) and [Onboarding a virtual server image for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial&interface=ui).

This service-to-service policy applies only to custom images in a private catalog.
