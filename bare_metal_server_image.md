# Bare Metal Servers for VPC images (Beta) 
{: #bare-metal-image}

Bare Metal Servers for VPC is a closed beta program and isn't open to new participants. Contact your IBM Sales representative if you're interested in getting access when Bare Metal Servers for VPC becomes available.
{: beta}

You can license the ESXi hypervisor that is installed on a bare metal server with your own license (bring-your-own-license), or IBM can handle the licensing for you.
{: shortdesc}

You can specify how a bare metal server is licensed by selecting from different ESXi image options: "ESXi 7.x BYOL" or "ESXi 7.x".

* The "ESXi 7.x BYOL" option provides ESXi in evaluation mode. The evaluation period is 60 days and begins at the time of provisioning. At any time during the 60-day evaluation period, you can convert from evaluation mode to licensed mode with your appropriate customer provided license.

* The "ESXi 7.x" option provides ESXi in licensed mode and is activated during the provisioning process. Billing applies for IBM rented licenses.
